**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/1kmu3h2/are_these_really_half_siblings_of_mine/)**: May 14, 2025**

*Throwaway account for privacy*

The context I have believed to be true for my whole 25 years of life:

•I am an only child to two parents who have not had children with any other people. I myself have no children.

•On my dad’s side, he has one brother who I know well and has never been married or had children. My paternal grandmother and grandfather only had my father and uncle as children.

•My mother has 4 older sisters. My maternal grandmother and grandfather had only the 5 daughters. From those 4 aunts of mine, I have 7 cousins. 4/7 are not close to me due to distance and age differences (my mom is the youngest of 4 as I said and she had me at 39). Two of those distant cousins have young kids around 10-12 years old.

These 8 DNA relatives all show potential half sibling relationships. For the ones that have a birth year visible, they are all born one or two years after me.

Given the percentages, to my understanding there are 3 possible relationships that share DNA percentages in that range: aunt/ uncle and niece/nephew, grandparent and grandchild, and half siblings.

Since the first two are 100% not the case in my situation, what do these results mean? Maybe my father was a sperm donor around the year I was born? That seems weird to me. I asked my mom today and she said that to her knowledge he never did that. She could be lying of course, perhaps wanting to talk to me about it in person or something.

Any and all thoughts are appreciated!!

8 half-sibling matches for OOP: 5 sisters and 3 brothers. All with percentages ranging from 23.1% to 29.2% match.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Is your dad’s brother an identical twin? Who may also have been a sperm donor?

>**OOP:** He is not an identical twin, he’s my dad’s younger brother

Top Commenter: Never wanted to follow a 23 post so much.

>**OOP:** Well this is just the beginning! I’m hoping to get some more insight from my parents when I see them in person. Also reached out to one “half sibling” I found on instagram

Commenter: Good luck. How do you feel about everything so far?

>**OOP:** At first I was just really confused, then after doing some research and realizing the only possible option for my relationship to these people truly is half sibling, I just started to wonder about how that happened. I’m mostly just curious. If I end up finding out that my dad isn’t my biological father, that’s okay with me. He’s my dad no matter what. I just hope that he wouldn’t be ashamed or upset to finally come clean about that. Or if he donated sperm, that’s no big deal either. I’m just curious and not highly emotional about any of the possibilities

Commenter: Sperm donor certainly seems like the most likely possibility. Your dad or a grandpa. Is your dad available to take a test? Hopefully one of the matches will contact you and you can find out some more info.

>**OOP:** I could get him to take a test, yes. But I’m almost certain that if the answer is simple enough for him to explain with something he’s withheld from me for whatever reason, he would just tell me

Commenter: Did you tell your parents you were going to do a 23andMe test beforehand at all? I'm curious how they acted about you doing one, like if they knew you'd find something out or not.

>**OOP:** No they didn’t know. I actually did this a couple years ago and never looked at the dna relative section. Just logged back in last night and explored everything and that’s when I found this

**Mini Update in Comments: 1 hour later**

Just texted my mom after our initial phone call where she said she didn’t know about any of that.

I said: “Hey you know I’m just curious right? If you or daddy do have an explanation for it, that’s no big deal to me. Doesn’t change anything in my mind”

She responded: “🩷”

I believe I was correct in assuming I’ll be finding out the truth once I’m with my parents in person

***A few more of OOP's Comments:***

*OOP follows up with a reply to a comment:*

>Thanks! Given how much I look like my mom, I’m pretty sure this is a conception via sperm donor situation. I do really hope one of them accepts my invite and is willing to talk with me. A few others have mentioned that they probably have talked with each other by now. I was late to the game given that I did 23 and me a few years ago and never looked at the DNA relatives section until last night when I logged back in just to explore what was available to me on there

Commenter: I would say either your dad is a sperm donor or you were conceived through donated sperm. The fact your parents didn’t have any other children might indicate the latter? This must be very confusing and a bit jarring, I’m sorry.

>**OOP:** Just looked again at the half siblings’ info, none of us share a maternal haplogroup, however the brothers all have the same paternal haplogroup. It’s all checking out haha

Commenter (downvoted): What if your “Dad” really isn’t your dad? Maybe mom had an affair with someone that has other kids?

>**OOP:** Well, my dad is my dad. I will find out soon whether or not he’s my biological father, but that doesn’t change anything for me. Based on what I’m seeing here with the other siblings’ profiles, all of us being conceived via a common sperm donor seems most likely

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/1kofjaf/update_are_these_really_half_siblings_of_mine/)**: May 16, 2025 (2 days later)**

Original post linked. I commented the update there but there are so many comments I thought I’d post it here in a new post as well.

The update everyone’s been waiting for! Sorry it’s not more exciting, but it is true that I was conceived by a sperm donor who is not my dad. I’ve gotten into contact with 3 of the other half siblings and it sounds like they’ve known this information for a lot longer than I have. I guess there’s a Facebook group as well for all the half siblings that I’ll be joining soon. My parents told me they’ll answer any questions I have and I told them I hope they don’t feel bad about keeping this information from me my whole life. To me, it doesn’t change a thing. My dad always has been and always will be my dad.

It’s kinda wild finding out something like this from 23 and me and then finding out the truth in such a public manner here on Reddit. But I’d like to say thank you so much to everyone for all the support and interest in my story. I never expected to get this kind of response and I want everyone to know that having this support did make it easier on me in some ways.

If anyone else is going through something similar I’ll be keeping this account for that purpose. Thank you again to everyone, if there are any more questions I’ll do my best to get back to everybody here :)

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Thanks for the update! Any idea if it is possible to determine who the donor is? I imagine that information is confidential with the sperm bank but wonder if any of the half-siblings who have known for a while have tried to narrow it down. I also understand you may not be interested at all who he is, and that’s ok too.

>**OOP:** We have limited information as far as I know. Not his name but his heritage and interests, like a bio about himself. I’m sure I’ll find out more once I join the Facebook group!

Commenter: Your mom lying and saying she didn't know anything about that, despite being confronted with evidence, is wild. I get if she didn't want to originally talk about it and kept it a secret, but doubling down is just awful, and I'd be really hurt to be lied to by my mother like that if I showed proof.

>**OOP:** That was over the phone and text. This was a conversation that came out of NOWHERE for her. Her gut reaction is to say what she’s lived as her truth for the last 25 years. As soon as we talked more she opened up immediately

**Editor's note:** I liked this one because of how non-dramatic it was, but also because it's wild how ancestry testing has brought so many things like this to light. We didn't have the usual blow-ups or crazy cheating allegations- OOP was very measured and reasonable in her response. I wish the best for her and her family!",2025-06-17 04:05:50

And the reason I never knew was she swore literally *everyone* who I might ever interact with to secrecy, that I was never to know.

Often these people have a sense of not quite belonging but no one can really put a finger on it.

Open disclosure needs to start from when the kid can toddle.  There is no shame in knowing that your parents needed donor eggs/sperm/embryo because they were unable to conceive naturally.  

There's a whole other medical history... and a sense of betrayal when people find this out years down the track.  It doesn't matter if they are still a kid ie 15 or whether they are 50.  They had something very big hidden from them for all their lives up until that point.  And often others in the family know about it.",2025-06-17 05:48:08

Well, at least they'll be able to talk to more of their relatives. That's something that some of these ancestry websites are good for, in a way.

TW: >!death!<

-----

My  TIFU actually started 3 days ago, but background first. My Dad was 56  and my mom was 46 when me and my twin sister were born. My dad died in  2007 when my twin sister and I were 12. He had been a heavy drinker and  smoker since he was 10, passing at 69 following decades of very poor  health so it was mostly a relief when he died.

My  mom and dad were married since 1973 and tried for many years to have  children until they had my sister and I in 1994. My mom only has us but  my dad had a son from a prior marriage who is about 30 years older than  us who I’ve met several times but we aren’t close due to the age  difference. He also had 2 daughters from another prior marriage that I  had never met, I only know they live in California and first names. They  also did not speak to my dad and didn’t attend his funeral.

As  I’ve gotten older and had kids of my own, I became more curious about  my dads family. I asked my mom to no avail, she said she had no idea  about why the girls didn’t speak to my dad. She said she also didn’t  know how to contact them. I ordered a 23 and me kit to hopefully find my  half sisters and get some answers.

Also, the idea of possibly being 1% black or Asian would have been cool. I’m white as can be.

So  I order the kit and 3 weeks later get my results. Unfortunately, I am  not any shocking ethnicity. 61.2% British actually along with  20.7%  French/German and other European make-up.

What  is surprising though is that I found 4 half sisters! 2 more than I  thought! My dad was not a picture of moralism so it doesn’t surprise me  he had some unclaimed kids running around. So, excitedly, I click to see  the names.

Oddly, none of the  names match my half sisters I’m looking for. This means I have 6 half  sisters! Wow, dad was kind of a whore but this is still exciting. My  twin and I immediately message them on the site.

The  first to reply we’ll call Mary, she says she was born via IVF in 1992  in North Carolina. Mary also said the donor was a med student. WELL, my  mom is adamant my Dad didn’t donate to sperm banks and that he didn’t  live in the state she’s from. So I’m thinking poor Mary doesn’t know her  mom is lying to her about an affair she had with my Dad. I felt  terrible for my mom as well as this would definitely mean he cheated on  my mom.

Like I said, my Dad was scummy.

I  just tell Mary that my (our) father was actually in construction his  whole life so he or the agency was lying about med school. He dropped  out in 7th grade! I sent her some pictures of my dad and my twin and I  from childhood. We laugh about how much we look alike and say we could  even be triplets.

Later that  evening, I get another message from another half sister we’ll call  Tiffany. Tiffany says she was also conceived via IVF in 1993 in  Pennsylvania. All she knows is her dad has blonde hair and green eyes  and was a med student.

I’m  honestly so happy to see another IVF because this confirms my Dad did  use sperm banks and just didn’t tell my Mom. Which was shitty, but  better than an affair. I send Tiffany pictures of my Dad and tell her  about him and that’s it.

Then  comes last night. I’m shopping at IKEA with my friends relaying this  soap opera story to them. I’m telling them my theory about these sperm  banks lying to their customers to get better prices. Telling people  they’re getting a blonde hair green eyed med student when in reality  they’re getting a brown hair brown eyed sheetrock worker.

It’s  at this moment my friend “Miranda” said “You and your twin have blonde  hair and green eyes...what if your Dad isn’t your Dad and your mom also  used IVF?”

At first I laughingly  entertained the idea that it would make sense for my mom to need IVF  because that makes way more sense than suddenly becoming pregnant at 46  and 56.

I quickly realized “Holy shit that actually does make sense.”

Then  came the obvious thought to probably everyone but me...how could a 55  year old alcoholic chain smoker pass for a med student? It would have  been 25 years since he could BELIEVABLY look under 35. Unless they  somehow had his sperm in storage for 30 years before using it,  AND the  sperm banks in different states used the same lie about med school, it  didn’t seem likely.

I also have  Type 1 diabetes and have no family history at all. Every doctor I’ve had  tells me how unlucky I am because it is usually in the family tree and  my chances of getting it were very low.

I’m  currently looking at my “half brothers” pictures and he looks just like  my dad but nothing like my sister and I. Not even close.

My  mom has had a migraine throwing up the past 2 days since discussing  this but I assumed it was a coincidence, now I’m thinking nerves.

I’m  going to talk to my mom today and if I get the answer I think I will,  I’m going to message my new half sisters apologizing for showing them  their Dad because he’s actually none of our Dads.

Pretty sweet my Dad might be a Doctor and not a raging alcoholic though, so that’s cool.

TL;DR I felt bad my 4 new half sisters didn’t know their father but as it turns out, none of us know our father.

UPDATE:  My mom admitted it! WE ARE IVF BABIES! I texted my half sisters this  morning to let them know. This will be a great party story.

UPDATE  2: I and my half sisters claim any and all movie rights to this and do  not approve any unauthorized use of this story. Be cool, thanks guys! /s  since some people can’t understand this was tongue in cheek.

Also I am a girl!

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/aitkr8/tifu_buying_a_23_and_me_kit_assuming_my_family/) Jan 23, 2019

So when all this went down, my sister and I asked my mom to take a DNA test as well. She agreed. As it turns out, my mom is not my biological mom. As I said before, it makes no difference to me because my mom is my mom no matter what.

HERE IS THE KICKER THOUGH

My mom was wholeheartedly under the impression her eggs were used in her IVF treatment. She is contacting her doctor who is still in practice to figure out what the hell this means.

I’m actually sort of sad for my mom, I didn’t consider this as an option in the realm of possibility. We are her daughters of course but I can’t imagine finding out at her age with adult kids that your biological line actually ends with you.

So yeah, guess that’s all I have for now!

TLDR; Mom is not my mom and she is more shocked than I am.

EDIT: I talked to my mom this morning and she’s ok, thank goodness. She said we’re still her babies! I discussed the idea of hiring a lawyer with her, she said she still has her IVF paperwork somewhere so she is looking for it. Her paper hoarding may come in handy this once! I’m just happy she is alright.

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/urqbc5/tifu_buying_a_23_and_me_kit_assuming_my_history/) May 18th, 2022

So it’s been 2.5 years *\[sic\]* since this  shocking (although very much makes sense) discovery. We have now found a  total of 4 half sisters and 2 half brothers, all on our dad’s side.  Still no progress on finding out who it is as the closest relative other  than the IVF siblings is a 3rd or 4th cousin. It’s fine, I mean who  really cares about knowing things like your medical history and literal  parent🤷🏼‍♀️

Anywho, we had even  less of a connection with our biological mom (who was also an egg  donor). I mean zero, zilch, nada. We were admittedly expectant every  time a new relative would pop up but the vast majority were from dad. As  time passed, we pretty much gave up looking.

HOWEVER,  after watching Our Father on Netflix last night (no, that’s not our  dad), I decided to once again check good ol’ 23 and me. And Voilà! First  cousin. Mom’s side. I attempted to send a message on the app but ain’t  nobody got time for that. I decided to utilize my investigative skills  (AKA social media) to see what clues I could uncover. Thankfully, said  first cousin put his mom’s maiden name. One Facebook search and I found  his mom which led me to her sisters’ profiles.

The  second I saw the picture of all of them, I internally (okay and  externally) said BINGO! No way we aren’t related. And if they tried to  tell me otherwise, I was going to offer to personally send a DNA test to  prove it.

No DNA test needed  though as I received a response in less than 24 hours that confirmed my  suspicions and filled my heart with joy! She wanted to find us too! NOT  ONLY THAT, we also have SIX more half siblings and a sports team’s worth  of nieces and nephews. We all live close to each other and are planning  a get together.

I know not all of these stories have a happy ending so it’s fun to share when they do!

TL;DR  Bought DNA test and found out my parents weren’t my parents. Ended up  finding new family that at least for now don’t seem to be serial  killers. So I guess TI(didn’t actually)FU 🙂

It is useful to have family medical history. I inherited not one but two (at least) genetic disorders so I’ve become a genealogy investigator. Why? Because any of my bio relatives could be unknowingly risking their children’s health/safety. I’d assume most parents would appreciate knowing to ask their pediatrician for testing so they know their kid won’t die of cardiac arrest on the playground. It’s important. 

But even with full-blooded relatives, they can still be assholes. They aren’t any realer of family than adoptive family. It’s just whether or not you could have the same weird mutations or not. I mean, folks get married and their spouse becomes just as important family despite (hopefully) being unrelated. 

Side note: If you learn you have a genetic disorder and know the general inheritance pattern, please don’t stay in denial or lie. It’s weirdly like learning you have contagious disease or something.

pu2trx,reddit_post,2313,"I just received my 23 and me results and I for sure wasn't expecting none of this shit!

For context, I'm African American and I was raised in the Midwest. What sparked my interest in this stuff, was that my father was adopted ( my adoptive grandfather was Haitian and grandmother was African American) and I have this weird blood mutation that is usually found in certain parts of the world. Please excuse my ignorance, genetics isn't really my specialty lol. 

So anyway the results were that I'm 68.4 % sub Saharan African (mostly Nigerian, Angolan, Congolese and a little dash of Ethiopian & Eritrean) and 19.2% European (mostly Portuguese and Spanish). Here are the kickers though, 6% South Asian (Indian to be exact), 2.3% Western Asian and North African and 4% East Asian &amp; Native American (my mom think it's Navajo) but this last part makes me question that lol. My recent ancestry is of Trinidadian, Brazilian and Guyanese. Tbh, I had a feeling that I was Caribbean (I thought Jamaican lol).

This is all a mixture of catharsis and enlightenment. I had no idea how much diversity runs through me. I've always wanted to know where some of my roots ran, now I finally have a start. For my next mission, it's to become a polyglot and discover my African tribes lol.

I knew my dad's side was generally ""Irish/Scotch/English.""

Oh, but the stuff that came out with DNA was amazing! I discovered Albanian and Turkish bloodlines. Wait, what?! I dove into German/Russian settlements during Catherine the Great's reign. The history was traceable and eye opening. I found out I have Ukrainian cousins.

My husband's side, I teased him I'm from poor peasant stock while his was errant bluebloods. He is a direct descendant from historical figures, a couple traced through DNA.

The important thing is ours is a common American story. We're here, we thrived in a new country when we left the old. That itself is remarkable.

We didn't find all this out solely from DNA. It had to be fleshed out by real people that were traceable. My sister-in-law is a retired analyst and is *so* good at this stuff. One of my favorite programs is Finding Your Roots on PBS.

The white man wasn't there first. He just did it in an age where it could be easily recorded and glorified.

Also, the fertile crescent had plenty of movement in it over the eons. To find Spanish/Portuguese genetics shouldn't be super surprising. Hell, look at how much territory Alexander, Xerxes, and the Khans covered. You can bet they spread their genetics around.

Finally, these tests are telling you where the genes are currently found in the world. This isn't a 1000 year history. You could have Nigerian genes and be Spanish due to migration through the west coast of Africa and vice versa. All these tests tell you is where the particular company you went with picked up the genes that they are testing against and how they decided to map them and tell a story.

Recently, a second cousin reached out to me on 23 and Me because he was looking for his biological grandfather. This second cousin and I shared about four percent DNA, and I gave him all of my maternal great grandparents’ names to help him in his search. Sure enough, this information helped him to discover that maternal great-uncle (my grandma’s brother) was his grandfather. This great-uncle is 90 years old now and he was excited to have found him while he was still alive. I let my mom and my maternal uncles know about this development, that they had a cousin they didn’t know about and my great-uncle had a daughter he didn’t know about. I thought everyone would be pretty interested and excited about this news. I couldn’t have been more wrong. I spoke to this cousin on the phone and exchanged family photos with him. He and his mother spoke to my great-uncle and wanted to plan a trip out to meet him. 
Since my great-uncle had just one son who passed away recently, he and his elderly wife relied on my mom and my uncles to set up bill pay, arrange grocery deliveries, order prescriptions, etc. they live many miles from his house, though and could only visit them infrequently. 
When I told my mom about this cousin and his mom and their interest in getting to know everyone, she was furious. She said she didn’t want to meet them, to let them know there would not be a get-together, and to request his DNA evidence as a screenshot to share with my great-uncle’s wife. My great-uncle’s wife also said she hated me and to never call their home again. 
My great-uncle has still been speaking to his daughter frequently and his daughter has even completed her own DNA test to prove her connection. 
To keep the peace, I have let this cousin know there would be no get-together, and that even though I am happy about his discovery, others were having a hard time with it. 
Despite the fact that I did this, my mom’s anger has only increased about this matter. In fact, She told me today that she didn’t want anything to do with me anymore, not to call her or come over. She is done with me. 
It is scary to see how this has effected my mom. The only reason I figure she is so mad at me is because my great-uncle was pretty wealthy and she is concerned this may impact her inheritance.

kh2avha,reddit_comment,9,"I had something similar happen a few months after my dad died.  Found a half sister.  Some family was skeptical and others of us welcomed her like she is our sister.  Love that girl!  So happy to have found her.

As the months and years went on though we found that we also had 3 other unknown cousins.  Two of them were put up for adoption which was a big secret because one was from when my uncle was 16 and the other was when he was out of boot camp before he went to Vietnam.  The third was an unknowns son of my other uncle who only had two girls.

I don’t talk to 90% of the people who raised me. My cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. My grandfather died—and members of my family attacked each other and others allowed it as it benefited them. My immediate family isn’t completely innocent—but I can sleep at night knowing that I am on the right side of the equation. I know that my siblings and some of my cousins never involved ourselves with that. 

I am really sorry this happened to you. But your mom and her financial goals have nothing to do with a woman seeking out her father. You did a good thing. 

If your mom wants you to disown you for this—it would have been for something else at one point. 

Let this reason of disowning you for being a good person bring her shame on her own when in time she realizes she has a great kid she is missing out on.

And that is pretty sad, sounds like we are talking about a man at the end of his life, whose only child had predeceased him. It sounds like a blessing for him to have found a child who wants to be part of his life. Having said that, I do understand his wife being angry because 1) this new daughter might be the result of an infidelity, and 2) this new daughter isn’t hers, and since her child died she might feel like her husband is sort of replacing their child in his heart, and 3) she might have come to terms with the fact that she and her husband were essentially a unit on their own, depending on each other, but now there is a new person kind of invading their space who has no connection with her. I think your uncle’s wife’s feelings of resentment are understandable. But it isn’t your mom’s business.

Before she disowned you, did you ever get to sit down with your mother and ask her to explain to you *why* she was so upset? Obviously, her reaction is over the top, and that's why I'm curious. 


I'm trying to think of another reason for her reaction because, honestly, if it's financial that's awful (my mother got jealous after my grandmother left everything to me so I've seen this).


I've seen a lot of stories here where family members get upset when someone unknown gets in touch and they're not consulted first as a family about what to do, especially if it means that an unknown child is about to be revealed. 
Is it possible that's her problem, that she thinks there should've been some discussion first?


Her disowning you just seems so illogical. Is it possible there's something more at play than just money. But maybe I'm just trying to be optimistic. I really, really hope that your family cools down and starts thinking clearly so breaches can be healed.",2024-01-10 15:35:26

She was counting on inheriting everything (why she was doing so much for the uncle, so they greatful and leave the money to her) and she feels that you messed it all up by introducing a usurper, and she feels her efforts were wasted.  She may not have much saved and might have been counting on that money to retire.

And if this new daughter was a product of an affair or was conceived with a previous gf your aunt knew and was jealous of, yeah, this would stir up upset feelings for her too.

I understand you did this because you feel the cousin has a right to their family, and they do.

I have one second cousin who if you asked anyone she is my mom's first cousin.  But in reality she is the daughter of her oldest sister. Older people never dreamed that one blood test or spit away could reveal all the dirty laundry.  

There is a chance that some family members knew about this daughter before now.  I say that because my dad had a brother he knew about, but didn't tell me about it until I did DNA testing.

I did my DNA test and I had Arabian ancestry and I never thought once in my life that I looked Arab😂 it happens. What I recommend is you also upload your RAW  DNA to GED Match.

Totally not letting me know that providing my phone number would blast my new account to everyone who has my phone number <head desk> I discover this when two friends follow me after the account was just an hour old.

Then Instagram. They're pushing me to make it a business account, I decide to check out the functionality. It asks to connect to my Facebook account, again not telling me they'll now share my new Instagram account with all of my Facebook friends. I back out of the business conversion, but my Facebook account is still connected. I log in the next day to see several of my hyper Christian family members have followed me <head desk> I disconnect Facebook and spend the next hour hunting my athiest and Christian friends and family and block them.

Original Post: 

> Hi All:
> 
> Long story short, I did 23andMe a couple months ago. My sister did it a month or so before and came up with shocking results. Basically, she had a secret half-brother and our father almost certainly couldn't be her biological dad. I did it too, after that. But I was more careful. I made sure to click 'do not share' every time I had the option. My results came back, and they were as my sister's. Probably no way my dad was my dad, and same new half-brother. But she was my full-blood sister.
> 
> Anyways, here's where it's fucked up: They shared it with relatives anyways. Now, maybe I clicked something I shouldn't have the third time, but I really don't recall it. I'm very well educated, and usually good with computers. I've also drafted statutes and interacted with law. Doesn't mean there wasn't some BS I clicked through quickly I shouldn't have. But if I could do it thinking I was fine, anyone could have.
> 
> Anyways, regardless, my sister sees my results.  She tells my father.  I go to visit my grandfather on his deathbed shortly thereafter, and my father starts asking me about this. Now I'm in this fucked up situation where I pretty much have to either lie or tell my grandfather I'm not blood related to him on his deathbed at 98 years old.  Totally fucked up.  The results have not been good.
> 
> Worst of all, I'm almost 100% positive I clicked 'do not share.' So I'm pissed off, but I let it go. Then today, I get an e-mail saying 23andMe is now sharing all users' data with Glaxo-Smith-Klein.  Fantastic! It gives a link where we can look up our account and see if we set it to share.  Mine says it's not set to share on two different settings.  Yet they shared it anyways.
> 
> Now, maybe there's a third setting for sharing with family members. But holy fuck, how many different sharing possibilities do you have to say no to before the whole thing's a sham to wear users down and catch them off guard?  I'm guessing odds are there's no case here, but I'm curious if anyone thinks there might be a civil suit that makes sense in it. I really don't give a fuck about money. I left a job paying six figures to go back and get a PhD and do what I love. But these bastards really fucked up my relationship with my family. Maybe it's reparable, I don't know, but I feel like the whole system is set up to ask you if you want to share multiple times, get you to say no, then sneak in some sharing at the last minute 20 menus and two months later. It doesn't seem right.  I'm not an attorney, so I don't know.  But if I could sue them and be just an annoying enough bee sting that they stop the shady bullshit, or at least clarify it enough that one other person doesn't go through the awfulness I have, I feel like I'll have done a good deed.

Surely that's a more simple explanation than her mother conducting a many years long affair and both of her children being someone else's.

As for GSK, my understanding was that all of the DNA sites owned  your data once you'd submitted it to them, so there was an inevitability about them sharing data in bulk for some purpose (likely medical testing) at some point.

As someone who’s a clinician working with many adoptive families, kinship adoption families, and queer families of many constellations, I’m actually kind of glad to see 23 and me and such having this effect. Hopefully it will put an end to families lying about who bio parents are, lying about sperm/egg donation, lying about first parents being dead or in jail, and all the other things I see that are so much harder to eventually learn about than to have just been told the truth. 

Kids do so much better just knowing what the truth is. It doesn’t make you any less of a family. Kids conceived by donor gametes are real kids with real parents, and an additional bio parent who they should be free to ask about and talk about. Kids who are from a previous relationship are similarly real kids, and have another parent. Adopted kids have two or more families. My kids all have several families. It doesn’t threaten me as a parent. I’m one of many “real parents,” and I can be without sending the message that their other families are bad or anything.  ",2018-07-27 15:34:05

es27no,reddit_post,1177,"23andMe is dangerous...

I suppose I'll begin with 23 and me..
The company uses your DNA to show your ancestry but also connects you to other 23andMe users who have similar DNA and is somehow able to tell you how you're related.

I got a result saying this woman (will call her Betty for protection) named Betty, is my grandmother.
She was more than ecstatic to message me and say how grateful she is to be my grandmother and would love to get in touch with her cell phone number at the end of the message. I was not so comfortable with the idea of family I did not know about.

About 2 years later she messages me again.
States she doesn't want to bother me but would love to hear about my life and if I'm ever interested to contact her.  So I replied just to be polite considering I never responded to her messages years before... the conversation leads to Betty stating ""my son and your father"" which makes me laugh and get somewhat aggravated at the same time to which I replied ""my mother is **** and my father is ****. How exactly do you know my father?""

Betty must've realized she pushed a button and responded with the following message...

""ThrowRA_scared, I don't know either of your parents. As far as I know the 23&Me uses our DNA match. From my understanding it is precise. You and I share nearly 20% DNA, which appears to be Grandchild/Grandparent. My ties to **** were my brother **** & his son ****. (both now deceased) My brother owned the **** restaurant for many years. My son **** spent lots of time with them. He ended up moving to **** in 1990's. Your picture looks very much like him & also like other family members. If my son is your Dad, it will be OK. No judgment ever. I always see on TV how people find relatives they did not know they had through these DNA kits. I was very surprised by our DNA match. As I said, no matter how, I am happy to be your Grandma. I just hope this revelation causes no pain for you or your family. My heart is open to you all.""

I left it alone but out of curiosity asked my mother. She has become emotional and claims she doesn't know anything about this and my dad was the only person she was with before I was born.

I can't concentrate on my job. My appetite has disappeared so I finally cave and contact Betty.
She has sent me pictures of her son which through evaluation of my girlfriend and some friends, shares quiet a bit of resemblance to me or vice versa.

If I persue this, how will I feel about my real/not real father? Do I tell him?
Do I leave this alone and continue with my life hoping I never regret not finding out?

Am I taking this too seriously? Idk how to feel or think..

EDIT: spoke with my mother last night.
She did recollect a drunken night when she was in highschool where my dad(raised me) and her got in a fight and she dropped him off at his brothers.
Then proceeded to go to a party with a girl from school.
She blacked out. Came too and she's in the passenger seat of some fellas car looking at the lake.
Didn't really iterate what convo was had because it was about 28 years ago and she only remembers being freaked out not knowing how she got to the lake but...
She said she was black out drunk but that females can usually tell even the following day if they had sex. She never thought she had sex with the guy but did find a hickey on her kneck.

So the door just opened up a little more and this is really starting to seem like a reality. Which kind of hurts. It's strange to feel like everything you know could be wrong.

LAST EDIT: just spoke to the suspected father in law on the phone last night and frankly I can't do it. It feels so wrong and he's not exactly the type of person I would normally associate with so unfortunately Innocent Betty is just not gonna have a grandson.

I've decided to block them both and move on with my life! 
And no, I'm not telling anyone.

ff7zd6f,reddit_comment,83,"So, I’ve been living a version of this as well. I recently did AncestryDNA and was matched with a half-brother I never knew about. I never met my biological father and my Dad adopted me when I was 7 after he married my mother. My mother always told me that “so and so” was my biological father and that there was no other possibility. Well, congratulations, it’s a girl, that guy was not my father. So not only did I find out about my biological father but I found out I have 3 siblings. I’ve been talking to my older brother over messenger and exchanging information with him, we were both in shock once all the pieces were put together.

This is just my experience, I’m happy to know my brother and to develop a relationship with him. The family is kind of broken up, the siblings don’t have much of a relationship and no one-even my biological grandparents- have a relationship with my biological father. He’s apparently a huge scuzbag.

All this said, I’ve been having a bit of an identity crisis. I’ve been in therapy for almost a year for unrelated things and then this bomb dropped right before New Year’s. My therapist advised me that this is unfortunately pretty common, and it’s *normal* to just not even know what to think or do. It’s huge! I was in shock for over a week and fixated on this information. Things are better now, plans are being made for my older brother and I to meet so our families can meet and we can all get to know one another. I don’t know yet if I will contact my biological father. He knows about me now. I don’t know if I’ll contact my other two siblings as I am a product of cheating. (This guy has 4 kids and 3 baby mamas.) I don’t know what to do about the rest of the family. It’s only been a month and I’m still figuring it out. 

TLDR try therapy. I know that’s tossed around and cavalier to say but seriously. An unbiased 3rd party can help you digest this information in a safe space and validate you! You are not right or wrong in whatever you decide to do. It’s all very shocking and existential. As for me, I’m going to keep going to therapy and try to figure this out!

EDIT: Also, I don’t know if you have children or plan to have children but if you do, then you need to confirm that Betty’s son is indeed your father because you need to know this for medical history! I can’t stress that enough.",2020-01-22 02:59:56
ff876ze,reddit_comment,64,"Genetic genealogist here. If you can confirm that you do actually share 20% then she is most likely without a doubt your biological grandmother. The other possibilities for 20% are if she is your half sibling, aunt, or double first cousin- and given the age difference, those seem highly unlikely.

First...."" The company uses your DNA to show your ancestry but also connects you to other 23andMe users who have similar DNA and is somehow able to tell you how you're related. ""   Yes, it uses your DNA to match you with other users in their database. These matches are accurate. Many people are under the false belief that these tests are for entertainment purposes or not entirely legitimate. This comes from the ethnicity part of them undergoing constant updates/changes. The actual DNA matches are solid. ( To confirm matches relationships use % or # of cM \[centimorgans\]. You can find charts to refer to on google or use a [calculator](https://dnapainter.com/tools/sharedcmv4))

This situation you've found yourself in is called a NPE (non paternity event) and it is actually a lot more common than you would think. With so many people taking these genetic tests now, many people are discovering relatives they did not know existed, or realizing they aren't genetically related to who they thought. I recommend the facebook group DNA detectives to help navigate this. Just join, lurk and read around a bit. You will see how common this is and also can reach out and get support on any questions you have. I also think you should take a closer look at your matches. Do you see anybody in your matches that link to the father who raised you?  You likely won't, and instead will see matches that link to Betty's family. If this is something you want to pursue, it's likely your ""grandmother"" Betty would be willing to purchase a test for her son (you mentioned not having the funds to test more family at this point). This would maybe solidify the answer for you. But honestly, a match as close as Betty's is pretty straight forward.

Your mother's reaction is not uncommon either. A few people mentioned the possibility of rape and while that is a very real possibility, usually the reaction is just shock and denial. It may take you both some time to process this.",2020-01-22 04:39:07

How old are you? Are you still living with your parents? I think if everyone here were adults this might be a little easier to manage, but it's never going to be pleasant.

This is likely a very different issue for your father and your mother. For your mother, it could be a secret infidelity revealed, or a miscalculation of timing on her part. She may or may not be aware this is the case.

For your father, he is potentially not only learning that his wife may have been unfaithful, but that the child he worked to raise is not his own. Regardless of the outcome, it's important to let your dad know nothing will change, that he is and always will be your dad. In fact, it's important to tell your mother the same if you confront her too.

Encouraging your father to do a DNA or even paternity test might shed some light, if you want it.

The bombshell does not change who raised you. My step-dad is more of a father than either of the two men I have ever known to be my biological father has ever been. 

Finding out is going to not feel real for a while. I would recommend seeking professional help if you're in the position to do so. Otherwise, know this is a personal decision. I made the choice of no contact with my biological father. He was an asshole who gaslit my mother and left her while she was pregnant with me to marry someone else despite promising to marry her. He is not someone I would want to  know.

On the flip side, I also now have lost a connection I used to a culture and heritage that is no longer mine despite being raised in it. I'm always curious about my siblings and my family history, especially as someone disabled, but for me it has not changed over the years. I still love my mother, still am in (some) contact with who I thought was my biological dad, and I am still close to my step-father, who has been more of a dad to me than either of the other two combined.

You are allowed to change your mind later. If you go no contact now, you can choose to open up contact later. I do recommend talking your feelings out with someone before you make a choice, especially when approaching your mother.

ff7tatn,reddit_comment,4,"The right move is whatever you feel comfortable doing. However, you need to understand that the situation she's describing is only one possibility. You would need to get a DNA test from the man you suspect to be your biological father to confirm this. Or alternatively, a DNA test from his known children or other relatives would help. The problem is that you don't share enough DNA with a grandparent to say for sure that the relationship is what she described. It's entirely possible she's correct, but the relationship could be more distant.

Take baby steps. First, you probably need to decide if this is something you absolutely *need* to know, or whether you think you can let it go. Think really hard about this before you do anything else. Either option is totally fine. As others have mentioned, the man who raised you is your father much more than the person you happen to share DNA with. I'm fairly certain it's possible to delete your profile on 23andme if you choose to go that route. Otherwise, if you do decide to uncover the truth, it would probably be a wise decision to get stronger DNA evidence before you make assumptions. In other words, I would not recommend speaking to your parents about this again until you have stronger data to back it up.

If you do confirm that her son is your biological father, that's a different story. But I figured I would give you some practical advice about dealing with exactly what you know so far. As someone who is fairly knowledgeable about DNA testing, I would assume there's a decent chance what this woman is saying is accurate, but there's also the possibility that the relationship is slightly more distant.

When you signed up you had the option to have them bank your sample in case you wished to opt in or upgrade to any new tests they might offer. You may have forgotten you did that. You can easily change that now and hit Delete Sample and they will *destroy your actual sample*.

You can also *opt out* of use of your data for research. Note, if you have been opted in for research this will not delete your anonymised DNA data that may already have been sold for previous research projects. But it will keep it from being included in packages for future research requests.

If things work out with the company to your satisfaction you can opt back in to the use of your anonymised DNA data for research purposes - your actual sample does not need to be there to do this. But you can't undo your decision to have them destroy your sample. However, you will still have your account, DNA matching, *and your text version DNA file will still be there*. You have to decide if you are comfortable with that in return for the benefits you perceive that you receive from 23andMe. 

If you go the slash and burn approach and delete everything (download you DNA file, delete text DNA file and close account), then be aware that if you opted in to medical research, at any time in the past, your DNA info will still not be deleted from the storage of universities and research institutions that purchased it as part of anonymized research packages. Nothing will do that as it is no longer tied to your account identity and was never tied to your name.",2025-03-25 00:01:57
mjieduw,reddit_comment,38,"This is from the Washington Post and as printed in the Star Tribune:

If you’re one of the 15 million people who shared your DNA with 23andMe, it’s time to delete your data.
The genetic information company, best known for its saliva test kits, announced Sunday it is headed to bankruptcy court to sell its assets. And 23andMe’s financial distress prompted California Attorney General Rob Bonta to issue an unusual privacy “consumer alert” about it Friday.

“I remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company,” he said in a statement.
The company said there will be “no changes” to the way it protects consumer data while in bankruptcy court. But unless you take action, there is a risk your genetic information could end up in someone else’s hands - and used in ways you had never considered. It took me just a minute to delete my data on the 23andMe website, and I’ve got instructions on how to do it below.

It’s a privacy nightmare, but also an example of how state privacy laws pioneered in California can help protect Americans - at least the proactive ones.

Founded in 2006, 23andMe was a pioneer in the quest to unlock knowledge from the human genome. It offers customers information about their family tree and hereditary characteristics, while researching new kinds of treatments.

But in recent years, 23andMe has been slammed by simultaneous business and security challenges. It went public in 2021 but burned through its cash and watched its value drop from about $6 billion to around $50 million now.

In 2023, it had a data breach that affected some 7 million customers. Hackers used customers’ old passwords to gain access to information that in some cases included family trees, birth years and geographic locations.

In September, 23andMe’s board of directors quit after rejecting CEO Anne Wojcicki’s proposals to take the company private.

23andMe didn’t immediately respond to my questions. But in its Sunday filing announcing bankruptcy, it said it “intends to continue operating its business in the ordinary course throughout the sale process.”",2025-03-24 17:26:16

I don’t think it actually has reliable enough info on your health to be useful to insurance companies. 

The only thing the tests can reliably tell is who you share DNA with, which is why that info was at the center of the DNA breach. And again that information isn’t worth anything unless you’re a dedicated genealogist who’s sitting down and comparing all the connected segment data. So unless we all get jobs working for the government/insurance companies/Spectre/Hydra/Cobra/etc., I don’t think this info is as useful as we think it might be.",2025-03-25 00:17:40

How to delete genetic data from 23andMe

The privacy risks

Bonta, the California attorney general, didn’t specify the risks of leaving your “trove of sensitive consumer data” with 23andMe. But privacy advocates I’ve spoken to have been watching the company’s challenges with concern on several fronts.

First, you are relying on 23andMe to keep your DNA safe from hackers. But that could be hard for any company to do under bankruptcy proceedings — and 23andMe has had plenty of security trouble in the past. (On its website, 23andMe says the company has achieved three certifications to demonstrate the strength of its security program.)

There’s also a risk that your data could get sold or transferred to a new company, which might want to use it for new purposes. The privacy statement of 23andMe seems to treat your data as a company asset that’s on the table like anything else. It reads: “If we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your Personal Information may be accessed, sold or transferred as part of that transaction.”

On the website page to delete your data, 23andMe says: “If the company does change ownership in the future, your data will remain protected under the current 23andMe Privacy Policy unless and until you are presented with materially new terms, with appropriate advanced notice to review those material changes as required by law.”
A new owner could also try to change the company’s practices and privacy policy — and it would be on you to keep on top of the changes.

“The DNA data could be used to discern your relatives and ancestry, unearth family secrets, and reveal clues about diseases you have or could be predisposed to. If the data makes its way to certain insurers, they may deny you coverage or charge you more for life, disability, or long-term care insurance because of your genetics,"" said Ginny Fahs, Director of Product R&D for Consumer Reports’ Innovation Lab.

“This is some of the most precious data that exists about you; you’re right to be concerned that it may be up for grabs,” she said.
But you do have rights over your data before any of that comes to pass. The California Consumer Protection Act of 2018 gives you the right to delete data from businesses that collect it. While the law specifically applies to California residents, many other states have passed similar laws.

And California also has a separate law pertaining to DNA data, called the Genetic Information Privacy Act. It gives you the right to delete your account, have your biological sample destroyed, and revoke consent you may have previously given to use or disclose your genetic data.

Before you delete your data, you might want to choose to download some or all of it. If you do, just make sure you have a good way to store and keep it safe, too. Unlike a password or telephone number, this is data you’re stuck with for the rest of your life.",2025-03-24 18:19:24

In the meantime, as someone said upthread, Chapter 11 just means they have protection while they re-organize their debt.

There has always been so much disinformation and fearmongering around DNA testing, and hitting the panic button over this news doesn't help. 

Speaking for myself, aside from having my DNA, 23 and Me actually knows very little about me: They know my name (which is a very common name), my gender, and my (anonymous, throwaway) gmail address. That's it. They don't know my age because I lied about that when I set up the account. That's all they know about me. 

Even in a worst-case scenario, where 23 and Me gets sold to some evil conglomerate who wants to exploit my DNA, how could that affect me, personally? *There is no chain of custody to prove the DNA actually belongs to me.* No health insurance company can possibly use my 23 and Me DNA information against me -- because they cannot prove it's actually me. What are they going to do -- hire Cece Moore to analyze my matches and build trees to prove who I am? That would get very expensive, very fast.

To prove the DNA really belongs to me, they would need me to donate a DNA sample in a doctor's office, after showing my identification, followed by a verifiable chain of custody delivery to the insurance company.

As for big pharma, if the DNA information is anonymized, as it almost certainly would be, I don't give a flying fig.

Also, I do have some Distant Genetic Groups from southern Mexico, and there were historical migrations where some tlaxcaltecas moved to northern Mexico. I could very well score on both Mesoamerican regions.
* **Will my trace ancestry (0.2% Broadly East Asian, 0.1% Broadly Central and South Asian) disappear, change, get larger?** I expect it to be absorbed/better classified as other regions, but who knows?
* **What will happen to my Broadly (4.5% total) and Unassigned (3.8%) categories?** I've long hypothesized that the Unassigned is actually Indigenous American, so I'm expecting that to be reflected with their larger reference samples.

Btw, there will be **two** ways to view your new **Version 7** result... 

1) Default (w/out Broadly percentages) 

2) Confidence Thresholds Approach (w/ Broadly percentages).

\-----------------------------------

Here I am quoting from the 23andMe Ancestry Team's posts:

""The default view of results will not be based on minimum confidence thresholds, instead we will simply assign the most likely specific ancestry at each DNA window. In this default view, ""Broadly"" ancestry and ""Unassigned"" ancestry will not be possible based on how ancestry is assigned and summarized.

In addition, we plan to make it possible for users to view their version 7 results with the confidence thresholds applied (from 50-90%) in Version History, in which case they may see ""Broadly"" and ""Unassigned"" ancestry again. This is because the threshold-based approach requires specific ancestry assignments to exceed the minimum probability threshold for a given DNA window. If it doesn't exceed that probability threshold at that DNA window, we move ""up the tree"" to broader geographic regions until the minimum probability threshold is exceeded, and then we assign that window of DNA to the broader region.""",2025-09-16 23:21:52

The vast majority of their customers are Americans that can trace their ancestry to those countries, so having that area be as detailed as possible is better for them.  Their competitors like MyHeritage and Ancestry already offer this level of detail.  I think you're overthinking it.

Albania being with Macedonia instead of Greece is strange; I don't know what's going on there.  Might be something with their samples that they can't consistently pinpoint that region, or that they are unaware/apathetic considering Balkan politics.

  
Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia are very close genetically.  Using Illustrative like you mentioned they are \~1.8 apart.

Danish and Swedish are \~1.4 apart...that's not a massive difference like you implied.

The British Isles pops are very close around \~1.0, but like I mentioned earlier, they have a financial incentive to split them.  

The gripe about it being ""Balkan and Greece"" instead of just ""Balkan"" seems like you're just looking for something to complain about.

If you have known Carribean roots it could stem from Indians that migrated into those areas early on. I get South Asia/India on my 23andme and AncestryDNA and other tests as well.

Depending on the Roma group you will see this in their results. I think AncestryDNA only accounts for Balkan Roma so seeing just India/Pakistan isn't a surprise.

If from the Caribbean it would be easier to map out seeing as Bengali are known to have moved into Guyana, Trinidad/Tobago and Barbados. So if you have roots there that could be it.

Regeneron is a major [biotech company](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/19/3083892/0/en/Regeneron-A-Leading-U-S-Biotechnology-Company-to-Acquire-23andMe-in-Court-Supervised-Sale.html) that focuses on developing pharmaceuticals with an emphasis on immunotherapies and receptor-specific drugs. They have acquired 23andMe through a [bankruptcy auction](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/19/business/regeneron-23-and-me?utm_medium=social&utm_source=igCNN&utm_content=2025-05-19T12%3A31%3A59).

They have developed many important drugs, including a COVID-19 treatment that was in partnership with the [US Government](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/regeneron-hhs-coronavirus-antibody-development/571651/) in 2020. 

Their reported revenue was approximately $14.2 billion in 2024 and have experienced continuous increases in revenue for the [last decade](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/REGN/regeneron-pharmaceuticals/revenue). 

With this acquisition, Regeneron acquires all units of 23andMe excluding Lemonaid Health, which was 23andMe's telehealth venture. Both companies have said that each of them will be operating as a wholly-owned direct or indirect unit of Regeneron. Regeneron also has stated that it will comply with [23and Me's privacy policies](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/regeneron-buy-bankrupt-genetic-testing-firm-23andme-256-million-2025-05-19/).

I'm pretty keyed in on my industry. I know how it works. Big companies don't just take a dive like that overnight. Even a company as trash as Atara is still kicking somehow despite the obvious issues with allo therapies. 

>Pfizer has been laying people off. According to your knowledge thats impossible because they are so big and awesome.

You don't understand how Pfizer works (or companies that function similarly). Layoffs are annual, regardless of how well the company is doing. The common joke among Pfizer people is that there's no reason to take advantage of their benefits (like education reimbursement) because they might just boot you out of nowhere during layoff season in spite of good performance.

I did it today. I should have done it after that breach after October 7. Here are the steps, lifted from Facebook. 


Here’s how to delete it: 

To ask them to destroy your DNA sample:

-> Go to “Settings” > “Preferences”

-> Withdraw any previous consent for your sample to be stored or used in research

-> You can also revoke consent for future research participation under “Research and Product Consents”

Note: If you ask them to destroy your DNA sample, be sure and do that *before* you delete you account.

To delete your account and all its data:

1. Log into your account

2. Go to your profile > “Settings”

3. Scroll to “23andMe Data” > click “View”

4. Select “Delete Data”

5. Click “Permanently delete data”

In [September 2024](https://www.timesofisrael.com/23andme-agrees-to-30m-settlement-over-data-breach-targeting-jewish-and-chinese-users/amp/) 23 and me was ordered to pay $30 million to American individuals who were affected by the breach.

obviously, I know there are nuances of course but just wondering your opinions on these kinds of discrepancy's! on 23 and me I get around 60 percent British and Irish and Under that my First two genetic groups are Irish one is very close then I have one fully Scottish one and then a Scotland and Northern Irish one. those are what show I used to have 6 though and one was England, and one was North England and Southern Scotland so still around that. Family tree Wise I know the only person in my family who genealogically is fully British Isles is my grandma and one half is Fully Scottish for sure they came from Aberdeen in the late central 1800s. and then her other side we don't really know but it's all Irish surnames going back and their probably Irish since my grandma never really wanted to admit she's Irish. then I know for my grandpa his is 1/4 Irish and 1/4 English and that and a little bit distantly on my paternal grandmas' side and maybe a small bit on my grandpas however I'm not certain. anyway on ancestry I get a similar amount I think exactly 60 and well its still fairly mixed its showing more English then what my 23 and me results and family tree would indicate besides my grandpa's side from devon we have no known oral information of English ancestry besides my grandpa being a quarter from Devon. and only after researching have I found some Distant people being born in England however they still had Scottish and Irish surnames for example the one person I found on my grandmas side. so should I trust 23 and me and my family tree on this? or more towards ancestry? id assume it be 23 and me and tree but I always like to hear others' opinions! I know there's a update coming soon which I'm sure could change it because before it was more mixed up and I had Way more Irish and Scottish and they actually got my Welsh ( 5 percent which seems to match up genealogically 3rd great grandma with Welsh surname) which also shows up on 23 and me and in my tree but unfortunately that's not on my updated results in October.",2025-04-04 22:28:41

mlhesdf,reddit_comment,4,"A few points...

You are assuming you know the genetic ethnicity of multiple people, but you're almost certainly guessing. Just because your 3GGF had an Irish surname or lived in Ireland or told people he was Irish, does not mean he would show as Irish on a DNA kit. Because none of those things prove his DNA ethnicity or the DNA ethnicity of HIS PARENTS.

DNA inheritance is going to throw your numbers off wildly. You get 50/50 from mom/dad, but statistically you don't get 25/25/25/25 from grands. The lottery is even worse the further you go... 12/12/12/12/12/12/12/12 for GG, 6/6/6/6/6/6/6/6/6/6/6/6/6/6/6/6 for 2GG and that's only 4 generations ago. You can ESTIMATE it using a paper trail, and you can back up the paper trail with ethnicity reports from MULTIPLE sources (Ancestry, 23, MyHeritage, LivingDNA, Gedmatch, FamilyTreeDNA, and countless others).

Genetic ethnicity profiles are going to be built upon databases of ""known good"" base kits. This means more accurate base kits and larger databases will yield more accurate results. But ethnic groups that lived in close proximity are more likely to have shared genetic markers. Irish/Scottish/English... that's not easy to differentiate... similar to Czechia/Slovakia or Norway/Sweden.  


My biggest gripe is that you came to the wrong sub. Should have gone to r/Genealogy if you wanted a less biased opinion. Also I agree with your assessment of the 23 situation. If you sent your DNA in to any of these companies, than you knew the risks (and they're much bigger than 23 getting sold).",2025-04-05 02:54:00

23andMe, when it was viable, was a good place to compare your data with other people for health traits like sleep apnea, early onset Alzheimer’s, or macular degeneration. It was no better than anyone else sorting out ethnicities.

Ethnicity calls are mostly BS anyway. If you have enough Irish or English to be noticed, then any of the testing companies we “see” it and tell you about it. If you want to know where your specific great grandparents came from, then you want a genealogy tool, which makes Ancestry hard to beat.

But 23andMe? They don’t have some sort of magic to give you are more accurate “Irish percentage” than anyone else. What they do have is a ton of debt, and a database of people’s DNA to auction off to the highest bidder.",2025-04-04 23:35:37

However I know its always changing so when it updates it could be more accurate to my research and compared to 23 and me. I understand it's all nuanced however its all interesting to me!

In my opinion, I would say ethnicities would be more distinct in the past. People did not have the means to travel long distances. I would think just that alone would be enough to keep genetic profiles from mixing.   
  
And then you have the likelihood of certain groups to ethnically intermarry... an extreme example would be the Jewish populations. But a more common delineation would probably follow linguistics or appearances.   
  
So a German likely wouldn't marry a French or Italian because they're more likely to marry another German because of shared culture... This is what helps to create these genetic profiles. Only the german population will have certain DNA markers from the mutations passed down over time. 

The more people mix, the less these mutations remain unique.

they have a tendency to just call noise/interference with their reference samples as being ""trace"" DNA that is clearly undefined.

They have done a good job with patching out some of those mistake, my biggest example is when they called everyone from the North Caucasus as ""Anatolian"" and added up to 30% southern european ancestry into Maghrebi people, as well as giving Southern Iberians trace indigenous ancestry for precisely the same reason

They were also unable to determine the Roma ancestry and confused it for West Asian and Eastern European components.

me is great when it comes to specific locations, but their reference samples are pretty bad

Ancestry avoids the vanishing mirror fallacy by associating ancestry with regions and only using ethnic groups where there is a distinction. This is much closer to how actual genealogists and geneticists categorize population genetics.

23andme is more pop and I don't think it's horrible for non mixed people.  It just has some weird flaws that they could easily fix if they just updated their samples.

But people like hearing that their .1% African or native American so instead of saying, this is undefined or just rounding it out they leave it in because they can't be bothered to update their samples. 

I think 23 and me is pretty good at finding out like which part of a country your ancestors are from but they easily miss out a lot of ancestry or splice it out to the point of irrelevance. They're still using Siberian samples for native Canadians for example and call nearly all Caucasians Anatolians. It excels at genealogy of European homogenous groups, though.",2025-07-16 02:14:24

For example I have 0.3% North African, which now shows as 0.5% North African on the Ancestry Composition ethnicity comparison.

So I'm suggesting that people click on their close relatives ""relationship"" pages and see if they can spot the API pulling data from the updated analysis that hasn't filtered through to our main pages yet.

m8hj28d,reddit_comment,2,Oh no i certainly have German ancestry around 20  to 22 percent I'm asking if my possible 1 to 5 percent Slavic heritage is likely true and is getting misread on 23 and me and ancestry. and as i mentioned I did family tree DNA i cant post a photo right now since I forgot my password for my results i don't really trust it that much from there it only gives me 6 percent central Europe and almost 40 percent Scandinavian I'm 7 percent Scandinavian max and i should be over 30 percent central European according to that category. anyway they give me some Hungarian for east Europe only further providing evidence for this and i did there test twice both times it gave me Hungarian.,2025-01-22 04:56:55

m8hn5fa,reddit_comment,2,"Well, it may actually be due the specific background you have. If you have roots in centra Europe it’s likely to have an excess east euro admixture due to shared/overlapping history.

m8hflh4,reddit_comment,0,"That doesn't make much since over 10 tests showing the same thing has to mean something.  many people take these tests into consideration 23 and me and Ancestry DNA are not law for ancestry.  and on 23 and me and ancestry many many of my matches get it as well even close matches who share the same ancestry as me. also, I haven't even researched that much, and I've found a ancestor with a potentially Slavic surname its obviously not super significant as its only 1 to 5 percent but I don't see at all what points to it being impossible for the two tests to get things wrong 23 and me doesn't detect my Scandinavian at an accurate percentage that doesn't mean I don't have it. can you elaborate what you meant by "" it's not significant"" and can you see where I'm coming from that there's a good chance I have some east European ancestry?",2025-01-22 04:33:28

Wired posted an article with information about how to delete your data from 23 and Me:

https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-delete-your-data-from-23andme/?utm_source=nl&utm_brand=wired&utm_mailing=WIR_Daily_032525

If you can’t access the article, let me know and I will see if I can share some more information.

Here is part of it:

“To delete your genetic data through 23andMe’s website, log in and then go to Settings in your profile. Scroll to 23andMe Data and then click View. At this point, you can choose to download a copy of your genetic information. Then scroll to Delete Data and click Permanently Delete Data. Once you initiate the process, you’ll receive an email from 23andMe to confirm. Click the link in the email to complete the deletion process. Additionally, you can direct 23andMe to destroy the biological sample it used to extract your DNA data if you previously authorized the company to keep it. Go to Settings and then Preferences.”

“You can also opt in to and out of participating in research at any time by updating your consent status in your account settings. If you opt out, 23andMe will stop using your information for research going forward and will discontinue use of your data within 30 days. This does not affect studies that have already been completed.”",2025-03-25 17:57:17
mjpk4pn,reddit_comment,37,"I don't believe that this actually deletes your DNA data from their database. I believe it deletes your account and your access to that information. They will destroy your physical sample upon your request that they make very clear. But they do not remove your data from their database. You signed that away already. They now own that once you became their customer. 

I emailed them in 2017, and learned they collect your sample, they identify your results, and then the sample data is separated from your personal data and stored into a database that cannot be reintegrated to identify you and your profile individually. But this also means that they can't delete your genetic data from their database if you choose to delete your account at a later date. 

Here's the actual quote from their response in 2017. 

""within the 23andMe platform, data are segmented and de-identified. Segmenting the data across logical database systems in this way prevents re-identifiability, even among essential privileged support staff. In other words, personally identifying information is stored separately from your genetic data.""",2025-03-25 19:36:29

mjrv88a,reddit_comment,8,"Think about it. Why would an insurance company spend millions to buy something that would immediately lose all value and never get another customer simply because the insurance company had spent millions buying it?

Seriously. An insurance company doesn't need your DNA to make a risk assessment.

They have your post/zip code.
They have your income level. 
They have your prescription history. 
They know what you search for online. 
They have or can get your claims history. 
They have the answers you provide when you apply for insurance - and if you lie or fail to disclose anything you know, they don't have to pay.

And if they want to, if you are applying for a large life policy, they can do 30 minutes of research and know what age your ancestors died and the cause of death in many cases.

They can also get the info on how often you order out and what you order to eat. What you buy on your weekly grocery shop. Whether or not you go to a gym.

They can find out if you or your business are under financial stress. 

All of these environmental metrics are just as good, in many cases better, than a DNA file.

Insurance companies used to work by making the right bet most of the time. Nowadays they don't even have to do that - they just pass the cost of their mistakes by spreading across all customers. As all of them do the same thing without any true regulation, they also know there is little incentive for competition. Greed wins every time.

mjt966s,reddit_comment,4,"No I’m literally telling you that 23andMe cannot consistently pick up major health issues in their test so what’s the point. There’s no “if the DNA sequencing was done incorrectly” because there’s no “correct” way to do DNA tests because everyone looks at different SNPs. Even cousin matching can be inconsistent. There are cousins I match on one site I don’t match on another yet both sites have good science behind them. 

It’s the nature of the game and it’s why 23andMe can’t consider their tests medical tests because the tests your doctors run on your DNA work completely different. Only in the sci-fi “if you have DNA, you unlock everything” mindset is any of this plausible.

Also forget about “in longer timelines” we already have way easier ways to get way more info on everyone including your health and DNA. If someone wanted to do something large scale, there would be easier ways to get it like say I don’t know using all the DNA from historical corpses that are widely available.

Don’t get me wrong, there are specific genetic tests that medical professionals use that catch that info but those aren’t the tests 23andMe is running. So again anyone who suddenly comes into possession of these vials has to re-test every vial (some of which got contaminated let’s be real) without the consent or payment of the individual at great personal cost to victimize only 23andMe users for what exactly?

l0kbuxb,reddit_comment,1,"The fact that you ended your statements with question marks implies some self doubt in those statements. While all too many people believe that the Noth African genetic component in Cubans (and for that matter Puerto Ricans and Dominicans) is coming from the Iberian Peninsula itself and is a product of the Muslim conquest of the peninsula and subsequent presence North Africans and Arabs, most of it is coming from indigenous ""Guanche"" influence in those that came from the Canary Islands to these Caribbean islands starting as early as the 16th century. Genetic studies of ancient remains in the Canary Islands that predate the arrival of Southern Europeans to the islands in the early 1300s (Castilian colonisation of the islands began in 1402) have identified the genetics as closest to the Berbers of North Africa. Evidence of this original inhabitants places them in the Canary Islands at least 2000 years ago. Visits to the islands by Phoenicians and Romans found evidence of structures, but found the islands uninhabited. Muslim Spain is known to have existed as such from 711 AD - 1492 AD. The last Guanche ""kingdom"" on the island of Tenerife is said to have been subdued by Spanish forces in 1493. 

While the jumping around in dates that I did may not make it clear, the North African (Muslim) presence in the Iberian Peninsula is exclusive of the Guanche presence in the Canary Islands (non-Muslim and apparently ""animist""). While the reduction in the population of the indigenous people of the Canary Islands is not unlike the reduction of the population of the islands in the Caribbean, the genetics of both groups survives in the currently admixed populations (as does  the Guanche genetics in the modern day population of the Canary Islands). This is most proven by presence mtDNA haplogroup U6b1a which as far as ancient remains has only been found the Canary Islands, and is most certainly seen in modern day Canary Islanders as well as in people of the Spanish-speaking Caribbean (both groups of which can be said to be ""autosomally"" majority Iberian Peninsula).

l1bglur,reddit_comment,1,"Considering both commonly have the same three inputs (indigenous, african, european), there's not really a case of who is more mixed than the other. However in PR you see more of a spectrum in ancestry and phenotype.

in PR you see pretty much the entire spectrum represented moderately well to very well, from purely European or at least completely white-passing Puerto Ricans being very common, to triracials being very common/mulattoes being very common, to black puerto ricans not being as common but at least not being rare.

Cuba is also similar to PR due to similar immigration history; lots of European immigration. DR never was an immigration destination for Spaniards or any other Europeans, so it never affected the demographics like it did for Cuba and PR

In the DR the spectrum represents blacks and mulattoes very well but doesn't represent white-passing or purely European dominicans very well. People who look like Carlos de la Mota are not at all hard to find in the PR in general or in the diaspora but they are definitely relatively rare in the DR and in the diaspora.",2024-04-26 07:02:31

l0nppdr,reddit_comment,1,"Have you or ""most people"" seen enough results from testers who are entirely descended from  either the Canary Islands or the Iberian Peninsula to make that determination? Your comment prompted me to run a small investigation using 23andMe+ on the test that I manage of a maternal cousin. She has a Nicaraguan father (my uncle) and a Colombian mother. Her percentages are: 56.4% - European (50.4% of that ""Spanish & Portuguese""); 29.5% - IA; 11.2% - SSA; 1.1% - WA&NA (Cypriot; Broadly Arab, Egyptian & Levantine \[no North African\]); 1.8% - Unassigned. In her Country Matches for Spain, Andalusia is #1 with no Canary Islands shown.

I searched ""Ancestor birthplaces"" for Spain, ""Has 4+grandparents"" in her DNA Relatives and five came up. Of these five, the range for Spanish & Portuguese is 94.0% - 100%. Of these five, three showed 0.0% - WA&NA. Two of these showed 2-4 grandparents born in Andalusia, Spain. Of the two that do show WA&NA, only the one that specified Asturias, Spain for two of the grandparents showed 0.6% - WA&NA, all of it North African. The other one shows 0.4% - WA&NA, all of it Coptic Egyptian (2 grandparents born Andalusia, 2 born Madrid).

None of these showed haplogroups that have been specifically found in ancient DNA of the Canary Islands: [https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(17)31257-5.pdf](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(17)31257-5.pdf)

That same article orignially from 2017 also states ""Modern inhabitants of Gran Canaria carry an estimated 16%– 31% Guanche autosomal ancestry.""

By contrast, my Cuban father shows the following on 23andMe: 90.8% - European (90.7% - Spanish & Portuguese; 0.1% - Ashkenazi Jewish); 8.5% - WA&NA (6.4% - North African; 1.2% - Anatolian; 0.6% - Coptic Egyptian; 0.3% - Broadly WA&NA); 0.6% - IA; 0.1% - Unassigned. So far, I have not been able to trace my father’s lines beyond the Canary Islands, back to the Iberian Peninsula, however, I am aware that “most” of his lines will go there based on the high level of Spanish & Portuguese. All his grandparents were born in Cuba, with his paternal line grandfather having come “in-utero” from La Victoria de Acentejo, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands. His haplogroups are Eurasian, with neither being known specifically as North African, let alone from the Canary Islands (R-U152 paternal, U2e1 maternal).

When I ran the same 23andMe+ exercise on his DNA Relatives for “Has 4+ grandparents” born in Spain, seventeen came up. I added to this the Advanced Filter of Ancestry composition for “North African” at 1% and the number of DNA Relatives within these parameters dropped from 17 to 11. Of these the range of North African was from 1.9% - 11.6% (the range of Spanish & Portuguese was 86.8% - 97.6%). Most of these specified the Canary Islands as an ancestor birthplace for 2 to 4 grandparents. I should point out that of these eleven DNA Relatives, two showed maternal haplogroup U6b1(U6b1a haplotype is hypothesized to be endemic to and a founder lineage of the Canary Islands; see article previously provided); two were SSA maternal haplogroups L2c & L2b1a (both also found in Spain and Italy, respectively); two were IA maternal haplogroups B2b & A2, the others Eurasian not found in ancient remains in the Canary Islands. This last point is noteworthy because one circular migration that happened throughout the colonial period was between Cuba and the Canary Islands (facilitated by ocean currents leaving and entering Havana harbor. It has been discussed as a possible explanation for why anyone with grandparents born in the Canary Islands would have Indigenous American DNA at all (5 of these 11 showed 0.4% - 4.4% autosomal, exclusive of hapologroups). The same could be said of the autosomal SSA with the added possibility of it having been introduced into the genetics of 8 of the 11 DNA Relatives in the Canary Islands prior to it arriving in the Caribbean: [https://accedacris.ulpgc.es/bitstream/10553/55574/2/BlackPeopleAHAM\_19\_ISSN\_0874\_9671.pdf](https://accedacris.ulpgc.es/bitstream/10553/55574/2/BlackPeopleAHAM_19_ISSN_0874_9671.pdf)",2024-04-21 22:08:18

“and it also estimated that ""All European Jews seem connected on the order of fourth or fifth cousins.""

“Concerning this relationship he points to Atzmon's conclusions that ""the shared genetic elements suggest that members of any Jewish community are related to one another as closely as are fourth or fifth cousins in a large population, which is about 10 times higher than the relationship between two people chosen at random off the streets of New York City"".[11]”

“Individuals within the Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi groups shared high levels of IBD, roughly equivalent to that of fourth or fifth cousins.”

I'm seeing a lot of speculative posts that Ark would blatantly buy into VGAC / 23andMe.  I just want to share the opposite view based on what Ark posted, and their current position.

&#x200B;

* **Ark wrote an article back in 2019**

**""Caveat Emptor — Beware of Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing""**

[https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/caveat-emptor-beware-of-direct-to-consumer-genetic-testing/](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/caveat-emptor-beware-of-direct-to-consumer-genetic-testing/)

>Issues with testing accuracy also extend to the subset of variants that DTC companies do test. **Several studies have exposed false positive rates in the range of 40% to 50% which have led to invasive tests and surgical procedures that have been unnecessary**. Some DTC firms combat false positives with secondary tests like NGS to confirm pathogenic variants, but many do not.  
>  
>**In our view, NGS is the best solution for genetic testing, given its superior accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and soon—affordability. While DTC ancestry and trait tests could continue to serve as stocking stuffers, NGS based tests are likely to dominate the healthcare market, democratizing accurate genetic testing, and improving patient outcomes dramatically.**

&#x200B;

= **Their long term bets are on 'sequencing',  not 'genotyping' (what DTC testing providers like 23andMe use)  - that's why Ark invested into NGS (next generation sequencing) companies like Pacific Biosciences, Illumina (exited), Invitae..etc.**

&#x200B;

* **Current status of DTC Genetics Testing (Genotyping)**

**""Accuracy of Genotyping Chips Called into Question""**

>Even for **DTC genetics testing companies such as  MyHeritage and 23andMe, which claim to use chips with higher accuracy, very rare variants will be susceptible to such false positives**, says study coauthor Caroline Wright, a genomicist at the University of Exeter College of Medicine and Health.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/23andme-lays-off-100-people-ceo-anne-wojcicki-explains-why.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/23andme-lays-off-100-people-ceo-anne-wojcicki-explains-why.html)

**2020 Jan (Pre-COVID) - 23andMe lays off 100 people as DNA test sales decline, CEO says she was ‘surprised’ to see market turn**

>Wojcicki has theories, but **she doesn’t have clear proof for why consumers are shying away from getting tests that reveal their percentage of Irish heritage, propensity for a favorite ice cream flavor, or whether they have a limited set of variants that are associated with breast cancer**. Either way, she notes, she’s downsizing because it’s “what the market is ready for.”

**Once-hot DNA testing unicorn 23andMe is in serious trouble**

>DNA tests went boom in 2018, with the number of consumers who had bought one doubling to 26 million; now sales have gone bust.  
>  
>**MIT Technology Review estimates that the largest DNA test players sold just 4 million to 6 million DNA tests in 2019, an industry growth rate of 20%, the slowest year for the industry ever.**

&#x200B;

**In short, you should buy into VGAC/23andME for only its prospects.**

gm35qrd,reddit_comment,18,"Not a lot of commenters are reading about what 23andme has become and what it’s been working towards for years. They kinda dropped the whole dna family gene test kit gimmick over a year ago and began restructuring around biotech data logistics just in time for the covid fiasco in Jan 2020. Perfect time to push their knowledge in data and the logistics pipeline of at home gene testing/therapeutics on top of a few other sneaky biotech innovations. 

The family gene testing kit was a great pr test to show what they are capable of. Once that happened they got rid of multiple teams focused on the genealogy tests and began restructuring into what they will announce over the coming months. Look into companies they worked with to produce the kits and see what they’ve been working on, plus the origin of the implications and affect they had on their market with the kits; then the product begins to spiderweb out.

I bought in when I first heard the rumor because I'm a big data fan, not because I was trying to front run ark. (And also because I was thinking there might be a small discount by disappointed space enthusiasts)

To me, It makes sense for ARK not to buy in, because they are only shooting for the farthest available targets. Trying to have the most imagination, largest ROI, etc.

Based on your article, I'm feeling more informed, but still holding, based on these three reasons (while I look into valuation)

1. 23&me has their data now. Agree that sequencing is better, and for something like an individual surgical decision, I would want it. But in aggregate, I think 23&me data still had value, 

2. I think they can profit off of it while also helping humanity (as opposed to, say, a tobacco company). If they are in the news helping enable breakthroughs, that will only help them stock.

3. If there is consumer fatigue, then it will take even longer for a good sequencing dataset to exist that will replace this one. The average consumer I don't think will care about the difference between sequencing and genotyping, especially if it is more expensive. If you don't have millions of people throwing their money and genetic material at you, you'll have to at best pay for it all, at worst wait much longer to get the same size data set.

I think most of the profit in the 'genetics' industry will be from sequencing, especially all future hardware, which is why I understand how ARK is choosing to invest. But it doesn't mean that 23&me is a bad investment.",2021-02-04 15:00:14

glz3l80,reddit_comment,0,"My guess is that there are several likely things contributing to the reduction in sales. The first is that all the early adopters who don’t care that their DNA isn’t being treated as sensitive HIPPA protected data have already made use of the service.

And then there’s the TV ads essentially encouraging white people to engage in cultural appropriation when they find out something about their DNA heritage. I’m not sure if those ads were before or after the South Park episode that made fun of the cultural appropriation around DNA test results. But the median thought across the minds of most of their target market is probably going to be “cultural appropriation = bad”.

And all the news reports about someone being able to be identified because enough relatives had joined the service. That probably didn’t sit well with a lot of people.

And in 2018 a different DNA company was hacked. That could certainly have people in general become more wary of using those kind of services.",2021-02-04 10:47:44

From what I've gathered in my family tree, they both feel pretty accurate. I don't think it'll hurt to do a test with the other, it may even help if you're also building your family tree!

I've attached a picture of my results from both sites to hopefully help you with your decision! I hope it'll give you an idea on how specific they get compared to each other.

nk9lsys,reddit_comment,2,"Pre-update I would have definitely said yes to this for sure, but post-update I personally don't think they are that good for trace regions anymore for some reason the new update at the ""most likely"" confidence level randomly omits trace regions partially or fully, but they reappear when raising the confidence level to 50% and above which doesn't make sense. This is just from my own experience but it seems they have gotten better at labelling them specifically though although not assigned as consistently which is very apparent when comparing my results with family members, my sister and dad still have the same trace ancestry in the same spot which I had pre-update but is now omitted only in my results somehow unless if I up the confidence level to 50-90% (but is labelled the same for all of us). The omission is also apparent in the 2-parent phasing parental inheritance feature where it says I inherited 49.9% European from my dad but completely omits the other 0.1% from my results which was listed pre-update. My dad also has a piece of his trace region just randomly vanish and reappear at higher confidences too. I'm pretty certain this is actually a bug though as I know a lot of other users who encountered this same thing and were also very puzzled by it.

  
I have also noticed more labelling inconsistencies for trace regions, including smaller main ancestry percentages post-update too. Also trace ancestry post-update seems to be excluded from the ancestry timeline a lot.

  
Also post-update it seems like they try to mash as many ethnicities into one category as possible even when it isn't in your background much, which is apparent from my new results. this seems to reduce the likelihood of showing smaller amounts, as a lot of my slightly more distant European ancestry appears to get absorbed into English.

  
My grandma also lost a legit DNA relative confirmed trace region post-update, it seems the new algorithm is less precise and less likely to assign them now. My trace ancestry still shows up for me in the AncestryDNA hack though.

  
I personally would recommend looking at the 50%-70% confidence levels and not the ""most likely"" confidence though as it is a lot more realistic for me. ""Most likely"" seems to force assignments into a category where they don't belong.

So yeah I do still like some aspects of 23andme, but I would recommend it more now for wanting to see more specific categories of your main ethnicities or for having multiple ways to view your ancestry breakdown not for trace regions. 

After the update AncestryDNA became a bit more accurate for me than 23andme, but it seems both do certain regions better I think 23andme is better for Eastern Europe and Southern Europe while Ancestry I think is better for Northwestern Europe also considering genetic groups and region assignments.

Anyways sorry for writing so much here I have a lot of thoughts on this lol. Hope this helps.

It's probably still worth a try for the comparison.",2025-10-19 06:16:34

1mlujwo,reddit_post,46,"23 and me cautionary tale

My mom is an avid genealogist.  She and I both did 23andme tests years ago.  

When they introduced maternal haplogroups, we noticed something odd.  My mother and her mother's sister's kids had different haplogroups.  That should not be possible unless the two ""sisters"" had different mothers.  

We went over the data and tried to figure out an explanation.  There were no indications that my grandmother and her sister weren't full sisters.  But DNA doesn't lie, right?  

We eventually decided that we'd take the secret to our graves.  Family is family no matter what and everyone involved is dead.  My grandmother and her sister were raised as siblings and as far as we know believed they were full siblings- best to let sleeping dogs lie.

And thank god we did.  23andme pushed an update and suddenly all the haplogroups lined up the way they should.  If we had taken our ""findings"" to the family it could have caused all kinds of upheaval.  ",2025-08-09 17:05:44

But both men in reality have the exact *same* haplotype, and that’s why I said a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, because I-Z138 is simply a sub-clade of I-Z58, which is itself of course a subclade of Haplogroup I. So both men in reality could be said to belong to haplogroup I-Z58, but the results for one gave him even more specific information that he belongs to subclade I-Z138. In reality both of them also belong to subclade I-Z138, because their full haplotypes are identical, but the differing results may be due to taking the test and getting their results at different times.

And see, if I didn’t know this additional information about how y-dna haplotypes and subclades work, I might look at the two different results on the site for men I know are paternal close relatives and become very, very confused.",2025-08-10 16:48:35

Before the update the only country in eastern Europe I got was Russia and the only Caribbean/latin American place I got was Puertorico and i identify as half Puertorican and half Russian mostly, but now 23 and me added Belarusian, Ukrainian, Polish, Cuban, and Mexican to my results. Before I took any 23 and me test my mom told me she was mainly Russian with some Ukrainian and Belarusian, and my dad told me he was Puertorican and Spaniard possibly with a little bit of Cuban. The Polish and Mexican result to this update was the most surprising. It blew me away the most. I had no idea I was Polish or Mexican. I’m gonna assume the Polish is from the Polish Lithuanian commonwealth era since Ukraine and Belarus were part of the Poland lithuanian commonwealth.
Can anyone give me an explanation how I have Mexican from my dad’s side despite Mexico being geographically/culturally far/different from Puertorico? The Mexican update blew me away the most and is the most surprising. 
Also about my Afro Puertorican heritage is it common to mostly have Senegambian as the main african region? And would it be possible for someone to explain which African tribe I most likely am descended from? 
About my Russian regions if anyone knows about Uralic or Finno-ugric ancestry and how likely I might have it I suspect I might have some distant minority Russian ancestries mixed in there as well. With North west Russia, Veliky Novgorod, and Arkhangelsk I suspect Pomor, and Nizhny Novgorod I suspect i might have some Moksha/Erzya, and with other regions I also suspect Udmurt, Mari, Komi, Nenets, Veps, or Votic. My grandma on ancestry also got finland/northwest russia as a result but im not sure if on 23 and me it is just grouped as eastern european just like Estonian and Hungarian are uralic but grouped as Eastern European in 23 and me rather than Finland.

On the Finland stuff, I know we have a similar story in my family as my maternal grandmother is from the NW.

mdzm5am,reddit_comment,2,"To answer one of your questions, this is what I have seen from one peer reviewed article and results from Puerto Rico. For Puerto Ricans the Senegambian is what all Puerto Ricans with deep roots in the island in about 5%. It apparently has been present since the earliest days of the colonization-early 1500s. The Nigerian/bight of Biafra tends to be from people who migrated/escaped from other Islands to PR in the 1700s, not all Puertorriqueños have that. Sometimes that’s reflected in last names like Roberto Clemente Walker and Bernie Williams. Seems to be most common near Loiza and the north east. Finally the most recent is Angolan/Congolese, that was early to mid 1800s, and the people who have that as their largest African tend to have 20-30% usually. That’s me. 23andme shows Angolan/Congolese as my most recent ancestry, more recent than Spanish, even though I’m 59% Spanish and only 21% SSA.",2025-02-21 14:02:31

Some people may say the 0.1% is buzz or a mistake on the company's behalf , but with your american diaspora ancestry  and the native claim , it is possible it comes from your grandpa  that claimed they had native ancestry (their family told them that as a way to hide the african  ) . So I wouldn't go around telling people I'm nigerian but I would assume your trace nigerian does  come from a recent african ancestor, as it is common to find those percentages in white americans",2024-11-05 05:06:53

lvigtwy,reddit_comment,4,"Yeah I'd be careful about it as well. Given that it's just a small trace, there's always the possibility it's a false positive or a misinterpretation by the company. If it's legit, you'd probably have to go many, many generations back to find someone Nigerian among your ancestors given it's less than one percent.  If it's something you ever want to discuss with people, you can always say you once took a dna test and came back with some unexpected results that are really interesting, but then acknowledge that it's hard to say what it actually means beyond being kinda cool. If instead you started telling people you're ""part Nigerian,"" it could easily be taken the wrong way.",2024-11-05 12:39:07

AncestryDNA was really similar to my 23&me results, only difference that 23&me noticed the Italian in me, while Ancestry didn't. It was only 1.8% tho (but latter I made my dad test and he has 8%). Plus while you can get your haplogroups from some tests with certain methods, but 23&me's baseline report is more deeper in that regard and more accurate.

ne0vk0d,reddit_comment,2,"* 23AndMe showed 100% Eastern Europe for my dad and aunt. My aunt only gets a region around Poznan and Warsaw. Their 2nd cousin actually did get the Lithuanian region I was expecting. My dad only had Warsaw until the regions update earlier this year and got Poznan, East, Southeast Poland (and a few others around Warsaw), and 2 in Western Belarus. 23AndMe seems to indicate more Belarus than the others (I've had this hunch).
* MyHeritage (uploaded both Ancestry and 23AndMe - similar results). My dad got genetic regions all over Germany, Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. Estimates were way off (but there are still patterns if you look at results from other Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusian, etc.), but I found a lot more meaningful matches here.
* Ancestry is roughly 75-85% Central & Eastern Europe, 15-25% Baltics. My dad and aunt had a bunch of regions around Poznan and Warsaw, but each update has been removing one per yet. Not too many European matches there. Fortunately, the ones that were there, were also on MH. It does pick up some minor populations like 1% Finnish, or 1% Swedish. Other cousins get 1-5% of one or more of German, Jewish and/or Balkans (mostly my grandfather's side). I did get 3% Romanian one update (don't know if that was my mom's Italian side, or some Romanian-Ukrainian on my dad's side - my grandmother's paternal great-grandparents were from Mohiliv-Podilskiy))
* GEDMatch - This one's the rabbit hole, and it's what started the whole thing when it showed far more Belarusian/Ukrainian, South Polish and Austro-Hungarian populations than I expected. Turns out, my grandmother's maternal grandfather's mother was Ukrainian, and father was likely half Belarusian. My grandmother's paternal line (through her brother's grandson) has the YP-417 haplogroup, which seems Belarusian. My grandfather's side has a lot of Polish-Ukrainians and German-Ukrainians (Black Sea Germans).

23AndMe's genetic regions were very accurate for what I was expecting, and MyHeritage's genetic regions actually were, too, to some extent. Percentages are still vague, though.",2025-09-13 17:13:56

ne1ljzn,reddit_comment,2,"I’ve done both MyHeritage and 23andMe, and while the results were generally similar, there were some interesting differences. Personally, I find 23andMe more accurate.

I’m mostly Balkan with some Turkish roots. Only 23andMe picked up that I’m partly Anatolian (8.5%) and even specified the European part of Turkey, which matches what I know about my family background. MyHeritage, on the other hand, didn’t show any West Asian in me at all but instead suggested Italian, which I honestly don’t think is correct.

I also uploaded my MyHeritage raw data to other services like DNAgenics, FamilyTreeDNA, and LivingDNA, but still, 23andMe gave me the most accurate breakdown. I especially like how they highlight specific cities genetically close to you. that was one of the most fascinating features for me.

When it comes to DNA matches, I definitely got way more on MyHeritage than on 23andMe. Probably because MyHeritage is cheaper and therefore more popular. For the price, it’s not bad at all, but in my opinion it’s not the most precise. 23andMe is more expensive, but I think it’s worth it.

The foundation of The Black American Community are the 1860 4.4 million Black American Population aka The Pre Civil War Black American Population. They're a distinct ethnic community shaped distinctively by American history unique to them and therefore their descendants regardless of how recent their White American ancestry was shaped their own identity creating an ethnic community.  

That supercedes Sub Saharan African genomes; i.e genotype or phenotypic expression; i.e ""looking Black."" There are full Black Americans who has much Sub Saharan African genomes as OP does or even less than OP but don't have recent non Black American ancestors as OP does because that's the history of The Black American Community which means that not all of OP's recent ancestry is shaped by that history and therefore aren't part of that ethnic community.

mghhs9e,reddit_comment,2,"Changing the name on a birth certificate depends on the country you are from. And if the U.S. I wuld guess the state but that's just a guess.

I'm in the U.K. and discovered my dad is not my dad last year then found my bio dad shortly after.  
Here you can have the name changed but just on the digital record not the paper copy.

We have a national government website for all sorts of services and on there is a portal for applying to have the certificate altered.

It requires compelling evidence and a DNA test with the new father at either a number of aprooved centres or in some cases commercial DNA companies like Ancestry or 23&me.

I don't know why the commercial route is a bit vague but I guess it's because tests can be faked and names can be wrong. There's a lack of controls.

A bit more on why this is a bad test for hereditary beat cancer.  There are many “breast cancer genes”. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most common/well known, but there are dozens of others. Additionally, there hundreds of spelling mistakes (aka variants) in the gene that increase cancer risk. Last I heard, 23andMe only reports on a few (I think 3?) of the possible hundreds of BRCA1/2 variants. And those variants are ones that are usually seen in the Jewish population.

 Yes, raw data from Ancestry works just as well, if not better.

kwqfq3s,reddit_comment,4,"Lol it’s such an insane narrative to push. The first time I heard that mess I thought they were talking about Hausa people. It’s bad enough when Nubians say it, but Arabs saying who is and isn’t Sudani when their identity comes from a whole other continent is beyond mental. 

The funny part is that they’re claiming western Sudanis migrated in when it’s actually mostly the other way around in most cases. All Nilo-Saharan speaking Sudanese ethnic groups originated in the area and then some spread west. That’s why there are Nilo-Saharan speaking groups with deep history in West Africa (Songhay) but not really Niger-Congo A speaking groups in northeast Africa unless they’re of more recent migration (Hausa and Fulani for example). Even genetically, West Africans all have a significant East African component in their makeup but most Northern East Africans do not have a significant West African component. 

As far as the articles I’ve read about Zaghawa genetic history, they tend to give a very overly simplistic rundown of Sudanese genetics in general where they divide them into two groups, the ones with high Eurasian admixture and the ones without. Arabs, Copts, Nubians, and Beja in one category and Darfurians, Nuba, and Nilotes in another. 

The problem is a lot of African genetics are heavily understudied and a lot of assumptions are still made based on racist/colorist/featurist assumptions. That’s why you have some Nubians going around claiming they’re Cushitic and gravitating towards Horners over other fellow Sudanis when they don’t even speak a Cushitic language and are (in oversimplified terms) of the same/similar stock of Nilo Saharans as the majority of Sudanis, just heavily mixed with Egyptians throughout history and that mixture recreates a Cushitic profile on paper. 

I’ve had this debate way too many times to not even be Sudani lol. It’s hard to find a lot of information specifically about Zaghawa, but something I do remember is that Zaghawa are actually a better representation of the Saharan DNA component within Nubian and Arab Sudanis than Nilotes, even though it’s more common to use them especially Dinka and Shilluk as proxies. So yeah, never let them gaslight you. You’re native pure and simple.",2024-03-27 01:15:20

kwvcezw,reddit_comment,1,"U is Caucasian not African. Caucasian, meaning Western Eurasian or metaphorically the white race. It does not specifically refer to the Caucasus Mountains region. U is very common in Europe, Middle East and North Africa but it's rare in Sudan. Most Sudanese have haplogroup L which is native to black Africans.
Haplogroup U6 specifically has a very wide geographic distribution across the northern half of Africa, the Middle East and most of western and southern Europe. It has been found at low frequencies as far north as the Baltic and as far east as Central Asia and Iran. It is most common in North-West Africa, especially among the Mozabites (28%) and Kabyles (18%) of Algeria, as well as Mauritanians (14%) and Canary Islanders (13.5%). Other regions with frequencies of U6 exceeding 1% include 6-8% in Morocco and coastal Algeria, 5% in Tunisia, 4% in Libya, 2.5% in Lebanon, Portugal, Egypt and Oman, 2% in Cyprus, Sudan, Ethiopia and Guinea-Bissau, 1.5% in Saudi Arabia and 1% in Syria, Jordan and in Spain.


Isolated pockets of high U6 frequencies have been reported in Iberia, notably 8.5% in Huelva (western Andalusia) by Hernández et al. 2014, 7% in northern Portugal by Pereira et al. 2000, 4.3% in northern Portugal, 4% in central Spain and 2.5% in central Portugal by Ottoni et al. 2011 and 2.6% in Catalonia by by Garcia et al. 2011.


U6 is only found at trace frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews and in most of Europe. The highest frequencies observed in Europe outside Iberia are in south-west France (1.4%), Brittany (0.7%), in Tuscany (0.6%), Sicily (0.5%) and southern Italy (0.5%).

I think is strange the hate Hausa and Fulani get for migrating but yet many Arab tribes claim to have Saudi origin which means once upon a time were migrants as well. Definitely ironic. 

😂 Exactly!! claiming an identity from a whole different content but then policing who is Sudanese and who isn’t is comedy at it’s finest. You’re not Sudanese but have more logic than the ones who are 😂. 

I heard the Nubian language use to be Cushitic until Nilo sharan Groups ( Nuba) conquered the empire and their language influence merged to become Nilo Sharan. Other theories is that the Nilo-Sharan category is made up of left over languages that they didn’t know how to categorize. I’m not truly sure if all this is to avoid being listed as a Nilo sharan language or if that’s really the case.

1kkeh8y,reddit_post,3,"Why on the 23 and me subreddit are the known "" typical"" white american results less common to be posted while on here they are one of the most common posts?

Now, it's not a big deal or anything, but this seems like an interesting phenomenon. Reddit is an American company, so naturally, it’s going to be dominated by Americans. Most Americans are currently white, so a large portion—likely the majority—are white Americans. Here, if you scroll for a bit, you’ll commonly find English, Scottish, and German ancestry in the results—something like 60 percent English, 20 percent Scottish, 12 to 20 percent German, and the rest possibly Welsh, Irish, or Danish.

Obviously, classifying what constitutes a 'typical white American' or typical anything is difficult. However, based on statistical studies, surname data, and migration patterns, it’s easy to see that, on average, this would be a very common white American result. Perhaps the Scottish percentage could be a little higher, English might be even more dominant, there could be more Welsh or Dutch, and maybe even a slightly stronger Irish presence due to a relatively close ancestor.

Now, on the 23andMe subreddit, if you scroll through the posts, you’ll see a different story—specifically among white American results. Many posts share some of this ancestry but often include a significant or at least 1 to 10 percent presence of Italian, Eastern European, French, etc. Even among those whose ancestry is primarily British, Irish, French, or German, the patterns tend to lean more toward Irish and French dominance, with small amounts of various other groups mixed in (my results being an example).

Obviously, this is just based on me scrolling through these subs over a long period of time, and there are phases where the posts reflect the opposite pattern. However, I feel like most people would be able to spot this general trend too.

A common question that comes up in these communities is, 'Oh, why don’t we see more posts like this?' The usual response is, 'People who have these results think their ancestry is too boring to post,' which unfortunately makes sense. However, the posts on this subreddit seem to contradict that idea.

I do want to preface this by saying that the term 'typical' in genetic studies is highly nuanced and not particularly useful, but it’s fairly easy to deduce general trends based on historical migration, census data, and research studies.

This isn’t a major issue at all, but I thought it was an interesting discussion to bring up. I’d love to hear thoughts on why this might happen.",2025-05-11 23:33:24

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/FVoB9oLTlE): **January 6, 2025**

I found out last night from a 23and me test that I’m most likely adopted or my biological dad isn’t my dad at the very least (not enough info on moms side to be 100% sure).

I honestly always had my suspicions, like the lack of pregnancy photos with my mom (who is obsessed with taking photos of everything) and a birth certificate with a different name on it that my brother found of his. When I found out she went on a backpacking trip to Europe when she was supposedly 7 months pregnant with my brother and I was 1 years old and the pictures of her looked like she wasn’t pregnant, this is what caused me to get a test. I got one for my brother but he backed out at the last minute for certain reasons I won’t get into. He says he is over them though, and is going to get one now.

I got the results of the test late last night, and I have a great grandfather on my dad’s side who isn’t supposed to be my great grandfather or supposed to be alive, but is actually alive and well! I also have an aunt, a few half aunts and half cousins, and a couple cousins I never knew existed and I don’t recognize any of the names. My dad’s family was also all boys so NONE of this makes sense. I asked my parents to take a dna test and they refused, so I don’t know what to do. I honestly don’t know what to feel. So far I guess I feel a lot of shock and a good bit of anger.

\*I just want to say that I realize now that my dad could have different bio parents and not realize it. But that is the only explanation based off the genetics in the 23 and me profile. I am not giving out all the info on why adoption seems likely bc it’s a lot of details but both my brother and boyfriend and I heavily suspect it. I am happy for the support I was given, no matter how small it was, in the comments. Thank you, it helped me realize that there are still a few alternative options. 

\*I just wanted to edit to say that part of my brothers genetic results came back. He is 25% Italian. We have no Italian in our family and I am 0% Italian. But that’s not even the most damning part. Our maternal haplops are different. I looked it up, and this means that we have different moms. I am going to take an ancestry test to try to find out more about my biological family’s history. Thanks to everyone who was kind and helpful. To everyone who says it’s nbd, that’s what I thought too until it actually happened to me and now it has actually affected me a lot.

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** What % does it say you share with your moms DNA? Should be right around 50%

> **OOP:** The parents that raised me aren’t on there. It’s other relatives, like my great grandfather that isn’t supposed to be alive but actually is

+

> And none of the last names match mine. I was lucky enough to get into contact with my half cousin, who funnily enough IS actually an egg donor and that’s why she’s on there, and she has the whole family tree mapped out going back to the 1800’s and there’s no relation to any of the relatives I know or my last name. And she has like 30 last names on her family tree if you go just backwards.

**OOP clarifies on if she has tested her parents already and how she came to the conclusion on being adopted without getting any answers**

> **OOP** Yeah I realize that now. I was super emotional and confused when I wrote that, hence why I went to the offmychest subreddit looking for advice. I Didn’t realize I would get such bad responses when I really just wanted advice and reassurance on where to go from here. I also posted in the adoption subreddit and got much better responses, where they cleared a lot of things up for me. Now I definitively see what all the scenarios could be, and I think I have a couple ideas of how to go forward. Basically, there are 3 options:

1. My dad is not my bio dad

2. My mom and dad are not my bio parents

3. Because of my family tree, my DAD could be the one that has a dad that is not his bio dad.

So basically, I am going to proceed more carefully as I wouldn’t want to upset my dad by revealing a secret to him he might not want to know. My brother is also getting a test to see if we are related. Idk, what do you think of that as an idea?

[Found out I’m adopted at 30](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adoption/s/TILlkrdvhG): **January 21, 2025 (two weeks later)**

I found out, at 30, through 23andme, that I was adopted. I confronted my parents and they admitted, finally, that both my brother and I are actually adopted. They told me my birth story and apparently both my brother and I were born to teen moms. My mom was connected to me and it was an open adoption and she kept in contact for a couple years, but my brothers mom not so much.

After my parents disclosure of my bio mom’s name, I told my second cousin and she knew who my bio mom was. The names and situation ended up completely matching up. I guess my adoption was not a secret at all in their family. My cousin said she would reach out to her to see if she wanted to talk to me at all. But yeah, I’m nervous. I know there is a good chance she won’t want to talk and I will just have to get to know my extended family and accept what it is. But I’m secretly hoping so, SO much that she wants to talk to me.

Has anyone been through this before? How did it work out for you?

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Finding out you're adopted at 30 is like discovering you’re the surprise guest star in your own life just hope the script isn't a horror movie!

> **OOP:** Yeah, tbh this isn’t the worst thing my parents have done so I’m not even that surprised. Lmao. If you don’t laugh you will cry. I just feel, on top of everything, fucking embarrassed that my entire family knew and lied to me my entire life. Everyone knew but my brother and I. That is the part that makes me the most angry.
> 
> Like, my parents said “we just didn’t tell you because nothing was DIFFERENT Katie”. Like, it just sounds like a lame excuse to me, to lie to me for my entire life about something so important. And of course, they are, and always will be, my parents. But I have other family too and an entire different genetic history that I fucking DESERVED to know about. For instance, I didn’t get the NIPT genetic test done while I was pregnant with my daughter bc there were “absolutely no genetic issues whatsoever” in my family. Well, that’s not true at all. I have no idea. And that’s just ONE example. I’m just trying not to think about that part of it bc it makes me so upset.
> 
> Trying to focus on the fact that I now know my birth mom’s story. When my parents told me, it was like I could feel what my bio mom was feeling and I started crying. And I don’t usually cry. It was the strangest thing. But it was like I knew before I was actually told, what her feelings were about me and the situation. I know that sounds crazy, but it is what I felt. I am focusing on the fact that my bio grandmother painted me and my mom a beautiful painting of a girl with red hair right before she died, and my adoptive mom just showed me today. I will treasure that painting forever no matter what happens from all this!
> 
> So yeah, all in all, I am trying to stay positive but it is hard not to be anxious and angry as well.

**OOP's thoughts on what age should she had found out about her adoption**

> **OOP:** As soon as the child can comprehend words. I would have wanted to know from the start. This is also what all the research on the matter clearly shows. Children are able to integrate the idea of adoption into their personality much more easily than adults who have already developed a completely different identity.
> 
> Obviously, it is ok to sugar coat things for children. Like, please don’t tell 2 year old me that my birth father didn’t even want to see me after I was born and that he sold the engraved watch with my name on it that was given to him by my adoptive parents 😭😂. And yes, that apparently DID happen, lol.
> 
> But big lies about where a child comes from, and getting the entire family to lie to them for their entire life? No, that is not good! I feel like everyone was in on an inside joke that was MY LIFE, but me. And also, I hate to think of what this is going to do to my brother eventually who is also adopted (he doesn’t know yet). My brother is much different and more sensitive, and he has said multiple times that if he finds out he is adopted, he will completely self destruct and never talk to my parents again. This ALL could have been avoided had my parents just told us casually when we were younger. Also, I decided to pass on this prenatal genetic testing for my daughter because I thought I knew my family history. That could have had lasting consequences for both me and my daughter because we don’t know our genetic background at all. These are just a couple examples of the very real consequences of doing this.
> 
> This all has also been a lot to process as an adult and has kind of changed my life. I didn’t think it would to the extent it did. But when reality hits, it’s honestly completely different than you would ever imagine it to be, I promise you.
> 
> My adoptive parents will forever just be my real parents to me. No matter what happens with my bio mom. They wanted me and my brother, but couldn’t have bio children. Yes, they lied, and this isn’t the first time they have lied about something big just to avoid talking about a difficult topic. But they are still my parents. I know that they both love me, and I know my dad especially loves me unconditionally. I just have this knowing deep down that I was better off with my adoptive (real) parents, despite everything I did go through in my family, and despite me being upset with them over this whole thing.
> 
> Tl:dr : you should tell them immediately. Me finding out at 30 has had lasting consequences, it has not been very fun. Despite this, my adoptive parents are my real parents and I will always see them that way

**Has OOP reached out to her birth mother? If so, what were her responses**

> **OOP:** So I DID get the number from my cousin, and messaged her myself. It was kind of a long message though, where I told her my name and birthday, that I just found out I was adopted via 23andme, and had been talking to/had found out via my cousin that was on 23andme already. I said I would love to talk to learn more about her and for her to learn more about me, but I also know she has her own family now and that she might not be ready to or want to talk to me for many different reasons and totally understand that. I also told her I’ve enjoyed getting to know about myself already through 23andme/my cousin and told her I saw a picture that her mom made for me for the first time that I really loved and appreciated.
> 
> Idk, was that way too much?? I sent this before everyone gave me the advice to keep it VERY short and sweet :/. It’s all just been so emotional for me tbh.

+

> Yes, she just messaged me back <3! She basically said that she is shocked and needs to process this (understandable) and that she is at work rn and would talk to me tonight. So hopefully we will get to connect. From what I hear from other family, she is a kind person so hopefully it goes well. fingers crossed!

&nbsp;

[UPDATE: IM ADOPTED.](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/TTM154R2IB): **January 23, 2025 (two days later)**

I mostly found out through 23andme. I first did the test on myself 2 months ago, and it came back with a completely different family line. I was so freaked out, because I had honestly been suspicious from the start, so I confronted my parents. Unfortunately, they continued to lie to me. Another red flag is my parents had been completely against me getting the test even to begin with.

To settle the matter, I took advice from offmychest (see my last post) and my brother did the test right after my results came back. His results came in yesterday, and I saw that we had a different maternal haplop. This means we are NOT related by mother. His family tree also did not match mine or my parents. My parents were upset when they had found out my brother got the test and wanted me to shut the test down, but I did not want to do that until I at least saw his results first, and I did in fact make sure I was first to see them before he did. When I saw the shocking results, I then paused the account, essentially, until I at least could figure this out with my parents.

I confronted my parents, again, and they finally told the truth. Long story short: they were infertile and they adopted me and my brother from teen moms after a failed round of IVF. I won’t get into the details, but the story of both me and my brother’s adoption honestly explains SO much of my life, it’s crazy.

I found my birth mom immediately because I had already been talking to my cousin and I said my bio mom’s name and she recognized it immediately. I sent her a message, and it turns out I have so many other half siblings, just on my mom’s side! I have been talking to my half sister who is pretty close in age to me as well. They all said they were waiting for this moment their entire life and said so many sweet things and i literally cried throughout the day it was so emotional! So I am going to keep talking to them and see where things go. Hopefully we can become close eventually.

Despite all this, and all the lies and bullshit where my entire family knew about this and lied my entire childhood and adult life, and despite the fact that I’m not happy with my parents, they are still my parents. I feel awkward on the etiquette of names for my bio mom, and I DO hope I can become close with her, but my mom is ALWAYS going to be my adoptive mom. Weirdly enough, this almost affirms that they really, truly, wanted me in a weird way. I know deep down my mom is worried she would be replaced, or have competition for the role of mom and that’s part of the reason they didn’t tell me. But that’s definitely not true. It would be lovely to connect with my family of origin and have them be part of my close family though, and I am excited about the possibilities but also trying to keep my expectations low.

I didn’t have finding out I’m truly adopted at 30 years old and meeting my birth family on my 2025 bingo card, but I’m here for it and it’s actually become more and more positive of an experience!

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** What an emotional and transformative journey—thank you for sharing. The way you’ve handled uncovering such a life-changing truth is admirable, balancing compassion for your adoptive parents with excitement for connecting with your biological family.

It’s heartwarming that your birth family is welcoming you so warmly, and your approach to navigating these new relationships with realistic expectations is so wise.

As for the relationship with your adoptive parents, your understanding of their fears and motivations speaks volumes about your character and love for them. It sounds like, despite their missteps in handling this, their love for you is clear.

Wishing you all the best as you continue to build these connections and process this new chapter. You’re turning a complex situation into something truly meaningful!

It’s been quite the journey but I feel like my daughter, who is little, is going to potentially have so much more love in her life and I’m excited for where this journey takes me. At the very least, i can tell her all about where she comes from and who her biological grandmother is. It turns out my bio grandma even made me a painting and gave it to my parents before I was born and it is very beautiful. She died shortly after I was born, so that is something I will now treasure forever!

**Is OOP's brother okay with the news received?**

> **OOP:** We have not told him yet. I guess he forgot the password anyways, but never asked me to help him get access to the account. I think he subconsciously doesn’t really want to know. So as long as he doesn’t really want to know, my parents and I have decided to let sleeping dogs lie. The test is there when he wants it, and then when he asks for the info we will tell him.There are other reasons for that as well. Personal family issues.
> 
> And no, I don’t know if it’s the right answer to do that, but I honestly believe it’s the best one with everything going on. It just becomes so much more difficult to tell a person news like this the older they become, doesn’t it? That is why everyone tells parents to tell their children right from the get go.

**Did OOP feel differently from her family growing up?**

> **OOP:** Yes. Interestingly enough, I felt psychologically different and my brother, who is also adopted, didn’t really quite look like us! My mom said that I was loved by my bio mom and her family, but my brother wasn’t, so I guess she decided she was my brother’s “true” mom, but not really mine! And she enmeshed with him completely.
> 
> He got everything he wanted, he never had challenges he had to face as a kid in order to grow up like the rest of us. Like, as a small, tinier example: he would cry on my birthday because he didn’t get birthday presents so he started getting birthday presents on my birthday until I was like 16 years old (he is 1 year younger than me). This unequal treatment and sometimes straight up abuse from my mom had really had disastrous consequences for me, obviously, but I didn’t realize the level of consequences this had on my brother until we got older. He has never lived away from home, never paid a bill in his life, and has no motivation to move his life forward in any way whatsoever. He’s stuck, and I honestly feel my mom’s enmeshment in his life is the biggest reason for this. I definitely felt like the “readheaded stepchild” in the family, mostly for this reason.
> 
> Even though I have a good bit of trauma from my childhood, it did ultimately make me a stronger and more loving person. And now I at least know the reason my mom is the way she is with my brother. So although it still hurts me, I try to remind myself that I got the better end of things in the end because I am mostly self sufficient. Also bc I care about other people than just myself, because I know what it feels like to be in that dark kind of place in life where you feel like no one loves you (even if that’s not completely true!). I do feel like I am finally starting to heal now, and maybe my adoptive mom will too, idk 🤷‍♀️

ma6kepb,reddit_comment,132,"Ladies - ALWAYS get non-invasive genetic testing. Not all genetic disorders are heritable. Many if not most genetic disorders are spontaneous mutations. So knowing your genetic history isn’t gonna help much. Also, some genetic disorders are recessive, which means that both parents have to carry the defective gene for the child to get it. If the defective gene is rare, then it’s not going to have ever showed up in either family. It will only show up in the child.

And even if you know that you would not terminate for medical reasons it’s still important to get tested. If you’re going to carry the baby term, you need to know what kind of doctors to have in the delivery room. And if you know that would terminate for medical reasons, something I've unfortunatly had to do, it’s better to do that sooner rather than later. Testing will show problems far sooner than an ultrasound will.

ma6w89t,reddit_comment,23,"I read the spoilers, but I didn't realize how bad it was for OOP until I continued reading this post.

**Part 1** \- OOP takes the DNA test, glosses over why her adoptive parents don't approve of it and even thinking out loud about the possibility that adoptive dad might be the reason why the results are what they are (even hinting at infidelity up on his side of the family). She even hints at the bullshit she went through but didn't explain. Until...

**Part 2** \- OOP finds out that her bio mom's family have been waiting for her to reach out after all this time; her late maternal bio grandma even left her a painting before she died! OOP reasons that her mother (specifically her adoptive mother) didn't want her to do the 23andme test was because she was afraid that OOP would replace her with bio mom and bio family. Then OOP drops the bomb: her adoptive mom loved her adoptive son more because OOP's bio family still loves her whereas her brother was not. It got to the point that the brother has no motivation to move out of the house.

I'm just waiting for **Part 3** where OOP makes the groundbreaking realization at how terrible her adoptive parents were about the favoritism and gravitates towards her bio mom's family.",2025-01-31 13:27:54

Family medical history is important, but the type of screening is different. Common inherited disorders that can be found through Carrier Screening are Cystic Fibrosis, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Sickle Cell, Fragile X, Thalassemia, and Tay-Sachs.

mjqwgyv,reddit_comment,4,"United Health buys the database and then jacks up your insurance premiums depending on what SNPs they find in your profile is the concern. There's a gazillion different diseases out there where homozygotic mutations lead to a very strong phenotype, but heterozygotes often have asymptomatic disease in 80-90% of the time. Well, if they know you have a 10-20% chance of developing symptoms of that later in life, what do you think they're going to do?

Is that legal? I have no idea. But just because it's illegal doesn't mean they wouldn't do it.

The other part of this risk that's easy to overlook is that say they have your sibling/parent's DNA but not yours. Well, it's not that hard to infer aspects of your genetics from your relative's with reasonably high certainty.",2025-03-25 23:39:58

Your DNA blueprint seems to be the most valuable and personal piece of information, so I cannot fathom some company having access to that data without any say from you, and use it for whatever financial gain they can.

If you happen to be a lawyer with specific expertise in this domain, I'm happy to read any sources you have to make such a claim.

But I do very much believe that if they were in possession of such data, they very much could use it to raise premiums on certain individuals and that they very much would find a way to do so on the basis of some grey area in whatever legislation does exist. I am definitely qualified to say that possessing such data would allow them to risk-stratify their customers at a ridiculously granular level, and that doing so definitely could allow them to more accurately identify which of their customers are likely to cost them a lot of money. So that part I have no doubt about.

A for-profit publicly traded insurance company would not be doing their fiduciary duty to their shareholders by NOT exploiting such data if they were in possession of it. So I don't think it's fear mongering at all to have the expectation they would do so.",2025-03-27 23:13:49

This however, is an autosomal test and so it makes sense they’re all put into the same category the same way Habesha Ethiopians and Eritreans will score about as much E&E as Nilotic and Cushitic Ethiopians. Also the Sudanese category seems to cover a broader Nilo Saharan-esque ancestry that has historically migrated/spread beyond Sudanese borders and into other countries (Ethiopia, Chad, Libya, Uganda, Mali, Burundi, Rwanda, Algeria, Kenya, Central African Republic, Tanzania, Egypt, Nigeria, and Tunisia), so it’s understandable why it’s a category that all Sudanis are under.",2024-03-03 06:22:04

I doubt attempting to give Sudan and South Sudan separate categories is a main priority, especially when Sudanese groups like Fur, Nuba, Zaghawa, etc all fall somewhere in between Nubians and Nilotes genetically and some Nilotic groups (Dinka and Anyuak for example) are indigenous to Sudan not South Sudan. What constitutes Sudanese genetics does not revolve solely around Nubians. This is made pretty evident by the fact that many Nubians with recent/high excess Eurasian admixture do tend to score significant WANA, Egyptian Nubians in particular. 

Clustering is also not really relevant in grouping people into regions or being ancestral affiliated. Nubians simply aren’t Cushitic no matter how close they cluster to Cushitic groups. Any group of people with roughly similar West Eurasian/East Eurasian/Deep African makeup will cluster close together. A lot of Mexicans cluster near Indians because of similar East Eurasian/West Eurasian levels. Doesn’t mean they should be put in the same genetic category.",2024-03-04 06:52:04

l61ghod,reddit_comment,2,"The word ""likely"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting, and genetics alone doesn't give you a way out of this one.

Your son presumably got \~50% Ashkenazi from you, which means he got \~46% Ashkenazi from his father.

If his father is only 10% Ashkenazi, that's presumably because one parent of your husband's is 1/4 Ashkenazi, and one parent is something else.

Ethnicity estimates aren't perfect - but assuming that the Ashkenazi is on his mother's side, that means that he has at least 3/8 non-Ashkenazi ethnicity from her.

If his father was an unknown Ashkenazi male, that would be a further 4/8, meaning that your husband is no more than 5/8 Ashkenazi even if his mother cheated with an unknown male.

That means that your husband could only ever give your son 5/16th Ashkenazi, to go with your 8/16th, which is 81.25% Ashkenazi.

You'd have to explain the remaining \~15% not by genetics but by the inaccuracy of the 23andMe test, or on the basis that the family's estimate of 10% (which I've rounded to 1/8th) is inaccurate.

However, you can ignore genetics and focus purely on genealogy - who are your son's shared relatives with his father? If you can assign paternal relatives to his father's family tree, in roughly the right proportions, genealogy can show parentage even where ethnic estimates can't (or at least, confirm that your husband *or a full brother* is the father, given that your husband hasn't yet tested).

However, if it truly is BS, there's no reason for your son's father to avoid taking a test and to demonstrate the relationship that way.",2024-05-28 15:59:05

Ethnicity estimates are estimates, based on your similarity to a reference population.

Those bowl are also quite different from each others (maybe less so for Ashkenazi Jews due to endogamy, but you get the point) so it's very hard to point at one bowl and say that's the typical bowl.

l62k16l,reddit_comment,0,"So by your logic, chromosome painters must be pretty useless then, huh? 

The genes don’t come with a label. Ancestry or 23 or whoever puts the label on them, which is why there are discrepancies between services, or why your percentages change over time. With each update, the results become more fine tuned. The only way you can confirm their accuracy is by building out your tree and consulting your DNA matches. 

I have 19% Irish as of the last Ancestry update, which I got solely from my mother. This squares with me having one fully Irish great grandparent, as well as a couple other Irish ancestors back a few more generations in a different part of the maternal side of my tree. It does not mean that I am a 19% match for people within the Irish sample group, it means that 19% of my genetic makeup contains Irish markers that Ancestry has identified within their sample group. 

Conversely, I have a fully French Canadian great grandmother (the aforementioned Irish great grandparent’s wife, in fact), yet as of the last update, I now have no French at all. SEE? INACCURATE! You scream. Well… no, because most of my great grandmother’s ancestors who came over from France were from Brittany and Normandy, where Celtic DNA reigns supreme. It is genetically distinct from the rest of mainland France. This heritage is now being expressed in my Scottish percentage, which (like many others) is currently overblown. You’ll find that Ancestry’s map for Scotland also highlights Northwestern France. This connection is made more explicitly clear by my inherited communities, which pinpoint the places my ancestors came from in Quebec with deadly accuracy, in one case down to an area of a few square miles. 

Anyway, tl;dr I’m sure. Just stop. You have no idea what you’re talking about. You’ve already confused genetic distance with a percentage based ethnicity estimate and continue to do so.

lhumxoo,reddit_comment,1,"I came to the ancient 'Tibetan' like people comment from looking at 100 plus results from Hazara/potowar region from genoplot, illustrativedna and 23andme. If the eastern eurasian component you got is really from Scythian it should also pickup the 90% ancestry that is not eastern eurasian, which would be minor European and more central Asian ancestry. All I'm saying is that the route that Siberian or ancient eastern eurasian took to get to you was through Tibet or ancient Tarim Basin. Talking about ancient burial mounds Search up Katelai IA indo-aryan Gandharan dig sight, they are a pre-scythian or hunnic/turkic people of swat and they also show 4-5 percent East asian admixture. All is to say is that the East asian component is not unique to Dhund abbasis, it's a ancient regional variation and admixture. Only thing that would set dhund abbasi apart were if they had picked up minor Western asian or central asian ancestry like the indo-aryan neighboring Kohistani people in north Hazara kpk. This would show a distinctive post indo-aryan West Asian admixture as compared to other tribes from Hazara. On the contrary Bro, dhund abbasi results are less Scythian looking than other Tribes in KPK hazara and even pre-partition hindu castes from kpk Hazara like the Khatris, and azad Kashmir mohyal brahmin pickup west asian and minor European. Dhund abbasi results look more like pahari Rajputs. Kashmiri or Janjua from Rawalpindi. If you want to look at the distance between you and other tribes in the region, you can input your raw data into Harrapaworld (free) or illustrativeDNA (paid). It would be interesting to know if you score closer to Kashmiris, Kohistani/khatri or other west punjab biradiris like the Awan.

ldaxcxw,reddit_comment,1,"Well among dhunds ancestry and physical appearance can vary atleast according to my experience. Since I’m from abbotabad/haripur region in KPK, it’s right at the historic entry points into Central Asia therefore it’s not uncommon to have some Turkic/east Asian ancestry since many such armies under Timur, Babur and even Chinghis passed through these points. However one important thing to keep in mind is that once a population arrives, and starts to mix, over generations, that original ancestry component becomes smaller and smaller. This I believe is the reason why such a genetic similarity is observed with North Indian and Punjabi populations. Plus I am half Punjabi.",2024-07-15 15:28:45

They are not much mixed because  they prefer to intermarriage. So their physical features is that region is typical nd distinct from mainland punjabies.

lhiibkh,reddit_comment,1,"The minor east asian percentage is most definitely ancient Tibetan admixture that is showing up for all the pahari biradiris/clans in Mirpur, potowar and North West punjab.

lhusm15,reddit_comment,1,"Okay, it looks like those matches are from the steppe indo-aryan ancestry all south asian share to some extent. The question is to what extent is that a component of your admixture compared to other biradiris in Hazara and NW Punjab, downloading your raw data and uploading to a admixture calculator for the south asian population like Harrapaworld (free) or illustrativeDNA (paid) will show you the different admixture for your region. See the image.

From what I have seen these are the typical non-Gujjar Hazara/haripur results, they are closer to Kohistani or Kashmiri results for Caucasion and NE-Euro. Gujjars tend to have less NE-Asian than Pahari biridaris, being pastoral It seems like they had migrated to the hills from further south.

The difference could be the isolated northern environment in addition to the difference in preexisting ancient admixture from ancient NE-asian and west asian (ANF,Caucasian/BMAC maybe?) instead of Indus Valley farmer population component. But it looks like the difference in appearance in North west Punjab is making people look for recent foreign ancestry, while it might as well be ancient regional variation between people because of the Indus river at downstream and salt range serving as a natural barrier.

So I have been using Ancestry to build my family tree for about 15 years now. I've built my tree up to a pretty positive 800 people. However the issue I've always had with ancestry (besides pricing) was the actual DNA testing. There is no real in depth information. For instance ""Germanic Europe"" just ain't good enough for me! The final straw was the last update when Scotland was wiped away for me.

So I decided to do an experiment and took a 23 and Me DNA test to compare. Here are the results and comparison!!Clearly 23 and Me is better!",2025-07-31 03:11:40

“Anatolia, a fertile peninsula above the eastern Mediterranean, has served as a genetic bridge between Asia and Europe for over 40,000 years. Early Anatolian farmers laid the groundwork for powerful civilizations like the Bronze Age Hittite Empire, followed by centuries of Persian, Greek, and Roman rule. The Eastern Roman Empire, Byzantium, survived in various forms until falling in the 15th century to the Ottoman Turks, who introduced a Central Asian-like genetic signature.”

l2g3dnt,reddit_comment,1,"I did check ged23 models already. It was along time ago, though I should check for an update.

I believe the 23andme algorithm is set for the modern population. This meaning, 7-12% of turkish genetic contribution is counted as Anatolian in the modern population model. This is why centeal asia comes in as 1% or 0% for some people.
This is my thought process, though.",2024-05-03 20:18:17

1lzh1fn,reddit_post,1,"Different results from 23andme

Hi ever i know this is well known and has always been an issue for both companies since they started but i have different results on both tests. On my ancestry test i am completely of European descent while on 23 and me i am 1.1 percent african and 0.1 percent native American. I am a very white person and both tests say im mostly British and a chunk german descent but i feel as though the African even though it is small is random and i would like to ask which is more likely to be correct? I understand that these are breakdowns and arent full proof but i feel like if it is bringing up African and down to the two countries aswell if must be there. I just want to discuss with everyone what their opinion on the matter is and what they believe on my and their own tests.",2025-07-14 08:31:19
n324mt9,reddit_comment,2,Try doing the ancestry results hack to see your trace regions. A lot of the time they don’t show regions that are less than 1% so the hack allows you to see those. I can’t remember how to do it but I googled “ancestry results hack”,2025-07-14 11:36:10
n32fltg,reddit_comment,1,"All ethnicities estimates are approximations at best. The science just isnt as good as what these companies advertise it is.

Percentages that low could be due to a distant ancestor, or it could just be because humans arent divided into near groups - we all share lots of our dna with people of completely different ethnicities. These tests attempt to say you got this dna from this population, but the reality is that bit of dna is not unique to any one population.

Basically, when the percentage is that low, it doesn't mean much at all.",2025-07-14 12:48:12

I know this said that this is connected to people related to me but I still have a question about it. If 23 and me says i have a very small amount of African ancestry down to the 2 countries exactly and even though ancestry didnt not pick up this small amount it still connects me with African Americans. Can i use both of these too say i have a small amount of African ancestry? Like one test finds it and the other say that i am connected but doesnt know how. Can i almost be certain that there is African ancestry in my bloodline if both test talk about it? Sorry for the long question im just trying to map stuff out.",2025-07-15 01:35:32

Have you tested with 23 and me? I haven't yet but I've always wanted to and I wanted to compare the two DNA tests. Should I do 23 and me next? I am also curious about my ethnicity and i have a potential half brother that I'd like to find out if we are related and if so, i'd like to get to know him. He can't take the Ancestry test or 23 and me because he's a minor and you need paretal consent and he lives with my dad and my dad won't consent to him getting testing done through these companies, he's very cautious about things. His mom isn't in the picture (long story). So i may have to wait until he's an adult to find out if he's my half-brother or not. Plus we live 10 hours apart and we have a 33 year age gap between us, he's 10 and I'm 43.

I have an older sister that I grew up with, we are 10 months apart, I'm 43, she's 44. She's my full sibling, we both have the same mom and dad. So I know my relationship with him will not be the same as my relationship with my sister, as me and him didn't grow up together and we don't know each other. I don't even know if my dad told him about me or that he has an older sister. I dont talk to my dad that much. I know the only way to find out for sure is with a sibling DNA test but I don't know how to go about that right now seeing as he's a child and I don't see or talk to him. No siblings came up on my Ancestry DNA test, no surprise siblings that I dont know about should I say. My sister didn't test with Ancestry and this boy he's too young to test. My mom doesn't have any other kids besides my sister and me. 

I know with 23 and me, you can do a family tree too, I don't know if it's anything like Ancestry's family tree. Did you do a family tree on there? I know with 23 and me you don't have to pay a subscription like with Ancestry and that's nice. Alot of people prefer 23 and me over Ancestry. Alot of people say if you are looking for someone, its best to do both DNA tesrs and be on all platforms. 

My grandmother when she was still alive wanted to test with Ancestry. Her mother and father died when she was a teenager. I was surprised that she even mentioned Ancestry, I didn't think she'd ever want to do a DNA test.  But she never got around to doing it before she passed away. So in a way I did the Ancestry DNA test for myself and my grandmom who never got a chance to do it, if that makes sense. ",2025-03-30 14:56:50

I already did an Ancestry DNA test last year, May 2024, and I didnt know about their World Explorer membership then that you get for $1 after you do the DNA test. I just got the DNA test kit on sale for $39 and I did the two week free trial. I don't have a subscription to Ancestry yet. In order for me to get the World membership I'd have to purchase another DNA test kit and i don't know anyone who would want it. So i don't even know which subscription I should get.  Would I be better off getting a cheaper subscription and only paying for a month or will three or 6 months be better bang for my buck?


I've heard about alot of people spending alot of money on Ancestry subscriptions and others complaining that it costs too much and some people stopped their subscription for that reason.


I got alot of hints during my free trial and I even get hints now. How do you learn the ropes on there? How do you teach yourself how to do the research? How do you prove every connection for yourself? At some point, should I stop with my family tree so it doesn't get too big? 


Have you used ProTools?  Is it worth it?Alot of people say that it's great for $10. I've been thinking about getting it. I just want my tree to be accurate. If you want a family tree book or poster you can go to mycanvas and they can print you out one. I'd like a keepsake of my family tree and my DNA on Ancestry. I've even seen people have a mural of their family tree on their living room wall. 


Do you have any advice/suggestions about Ancestry about the family tree and research? What did you do with your research/family tree, did you save it, print it out and keep it as a keepsake? I'm new to DNA testing, family trees and research.",2025-03-30 15:31:17

Alot of people are telling me not to buy a kit from them because I'd just be wasting my money and I don't know who they will be selling the company to, what will happen to my DNA and if they fold and close up shop, I'm screwed and out of money. I've always wanted to try 23 and me after I did Ancestry. I was curious about my ethnicity. You think I should buy a kit despite the negative comments from alot of people about the bankruptcy and company? 
Should I store my DNA like I did with Ancestry? I just wanted to do the basic Ancestry on 23 and me, not the health and ancestry. 



Does 23 and me tell you what regions your ancestors are from? Example I'm Irish and Italian will it say for example Italian, Abruzzo or Ireland County Mayo or Donegal or Dublin? I always wondered what the 13+ regions meant on the DNA results? 


Ive heard a few people say that the tree on 23 and me isn't great, so i won't do a tree on there. I have one on Ancestry and I'll do one on Family Search for free. ",2025-03-30 16:26:10

You never lose the research when you do not have an active membership.  Keep researching keeping records of what you want to see, looking at others trees, and when you have time, do it all over again.  

I have not looked at their pro tools, as I do not fully know what they offer, and have not yet researched what they offer.   Alas, AncestryDNA has very much bought into the “pay for extra model” and it can get pricey.

However, while on her profile it said, 2nd cousin, on mines it said half 1st cousin. The man's dad on mine says Half Uncle, but on my sister's account, it says grand uncle i think? Why would it show different results? Is it just because it can only be predicted? 
         Also, I've tried contacting some of these people, but Ig they have no interest in chatting with me. I am a stranger after all. But it does kind of make more sense that my predicted half cousin would be just that. He also looks no more than 7 years older than me, which is within the range of a first cousin. He looks a lot like my dad, when my dad was young. 
         Also, since my dad has always been alone, and never knew anything about his biological family, I've chosen to not tell him about this. There's no point if these people aren't interested in chatting with me. Plus, it's only a 23 and me prediction, so I can't say for certainty that this is 100% accurate. Its too bad though, it is what it is.",2025-03-30 03:01:26

mkiwd00,reddit_comment,2,It shows different results because it is only a prediction based on your % shared. I suspect it also uses age to make its best guess because I have a 2nd cousin who is 20ish years older who comes up as 1st cousin once removed. Anyways if you plug your % match in to [DNA painter](https://dnapainter.com/tools/sharedcmv4) it will give you all possibilities. If the persons birth year is shared you can likely narrow it down and make an educated guess from there.,2025-03-30 14:44:18

mjtcory,reddit_comment,1,"Such a nightmare situation for you!  A class action law suit is going to take years until a final outcome.  I am currently participating in a class action law suit that’s been ongoing for over 3 years.  Settlement may be a minimum amount.   Are you willing to allocate your valuable time on a law suit that will take years to resolve and   still not have your important DNA results?  It might be a thought to try focusing on your important DNA results rather than a class action law suit.  Just saying…. Your choice….

You might try transferring DNA results to another company, like FTDNA (See below), unless  a photo ID Is still required.  FTDNA is focused  on DNA connections, but has no research documents or membership fees like [Ancestry.com](http://Ancestry.com) or My Heritage.  FTDNA was one of the first companies to process dna and continues to advance their techniques.  I have been satisfied with this company before autosomal testing was introduced to the public  many years ago.   

If a transfer is not an option, order another DNA test when on sale from a reputable company.  There may be sales upcoming soon for the Easter holiday.  It might be less expensive than waiting years for a lawsuit and still having no DNA results.  

It’s a disappointment to hear that the company did not give a contact number to request a manager for assistance. They may have made an exception and offered another way of verifying your account, such as email address, ect. 

Let us know final decisions!

Subsaharan African is the human race's locus or center of diversity. There is high genetic variation between groups like Bantus and Khoisan (as opposed to Europe which despite ""nine eves"" and stuff like that are basically all pretty closely related to each other ... and I imagine the Americas were even more so). Also in West Africa you have individuals with ""archaic"" genomes that most human populations don't have due to founder effects/bottlenecking from the great migrations. 

Why someone would be so invested in try to prove that the ancient land of Kush was not connected to ancient Egypt is really one of those head scratchers that defies all logic.

At that point it'd honestly be more surprising if he *wasn't* an ancestor of anyone with family origins in the general region. Last time I did the math it was only 7-8 centuries back before any person's birth where there's something like a million spots on the family tree to fill in at that generational distance alone and this guy is another 2000+ years before that. Even tracing along your direct patrilineal or matrilineal line is going to just get absurd after a few hundred years let alone thousands.

Yes, as long as you have a provider who recognizes it, he or she can still test you for the symptoms and confirm that you have them. The issue with misophonia is somewhat twofold. 

It's a fairly ""new"" condition as far as our understanding of it goes, and the term ""misophonia"" wasn't even in use until about 2000. For a similar example, just consider Tourette's, which wasn't even in the DCM until the 2022 revision of the DCM-5. The second issue is that misophonia is typically seen as a **symptom** of an underlying condition— usually some kind of ASD— rather than an ailment in and of itself.",2024-11-13 17:20:06

For example I’m an Ashkenazi Jew from Poland, I plot closer to a Maltese person than an Ashkenazi from Germany, that doesn’t mean I’m more Maltese than ashkenazi tho.

Race is subjective, you’re middle eastern. Iraqi Jews are a mix of levant and Mesopotamia to my understanding, I’ll go find a g25 of one so u can better understand your admixture, but Iraqi Jews just like most Jewish diaspora groups have their origin in the levant.

- even in Mandaean mythology you can find legends where conversions happened both ways.
- Mandaean Aramaic when read it is almost the same dialect as the Babylonian Talmud. However the letters are different.

So we are an ethnic religion, we date back to Mesopotamian times and our inherent language is a dialect of Aramaic (mandaic) though we do not speak it anymore unless it is for religious purposes as we had to assimilate with the Arabs after the 7th century AD invasion. The reason you have some of our DNA type is simple! As mandaeans, we have some Jewish DNA in us too! We lived alongside each other Millenia ago and of course due to invasions, religious persecutions from the Arabs and what not, we were all forced to hide our ethnicities and faiths therefore mixing our DNA. However, if someone tells you, like I have seen in the comments, that we originated FROM Jews, that’s simply not true as there are archeological artefacts and art etc that dates back Millenia ago and recent studies indicate that we did in fact originate in Mesopotamia and another group of mandaeans, Persian mandaeans, from Iran !

kia751r,reddit_comment,1,"In regards to the Mandaeans being descendants of Seth, I don’t believe that is in line with our scriptures as according to the Ginza Rabba (blessed its name) right side book 1 verse 178: “This is the first doctrine which was given to Adam, the head of the living stem. It was one word and it was one testimony,” which pretty much states that the head of the living stem (the Mandaean community) is Adam and as it is well known according to many religious scriptures, Adam is the first human being.   


As for Seth, a man by the name of **Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni** who was an Iranian scholar and polymath in his book Kitab al-Atar al-baqiya (wr. circa 1000) remarks about a group of Sabians and he distinguishes sharply between two groups of **Sabians and one of those where in southern Iraq (Sawad al-Iraq) who trace their lineage from Anush son of Seth**. In an **Arabic work of alHasan ibn Bahlul (fl. circa 950-1000)**, another learned member of the Church of the East identifies the Mandaeans as Sabians in his book called Kitab ad-Dala’il (Book of Indications), a book of astronomical, astrological, and calendrical lore that is a treasure of citations of ancient sources. One of the chapters of his Kitab ad-Dalail presents an extraordinary, detailed, and detached (if not sympathetic) description of sectarian villagers, deriving from the first half of the tenth century, cited from an author whom Ibn Bahlul names as “Abu ‘Ali.’  
  
Chapter 41: The Sect of the Sabians Residing in al-Gamida and al-Hawanit and Sitraya, of the Districts of Wasit  
Abu ‘Ali—may God have mercy on him—-said:  
They are the ones mentioned in the Qur'an. Their status as dimmis is sound. There is no relationship between them and the Harranian pagans (hunafa’), nor is there any point of comparison in any aspect of their religious laws (asSarai‘). Rather they are distinct from them in every way. A few of them came into my presence in the City of Peace \[Bagdad\] in the days of my employment as secretary (kitbati) for Sara, the daughter of al-Mu‘tadid billah \[the caliph, r. 892—902\]|—may God have mercy on him—and my employment as secretary for her mother and for her sister Safiya. I had requested for Sara’s mother as an administrative land grant (istagta‘tu) \[the site of\] Bayadir,’ known as “the Jewish” (al-Yahudi), in al-Gamida, and ad-Dil in as-Saliq, all of whose inhabitants are Sabians (Sab’un). So I investigated their situation and queried them about it thoroughly. **I found that they profess the religion of Seth son of Adam**, peace be upon him. They say that he is their prophet. They acknowledge John son of Zachariah.  
  
Mandaeans are also mentioned by the prolific scholar **Yaqut al-Hamawi** , writing in the years leading up to 1228, alludes to the Mandaeans in his entry on the village of at-Tib:  
a little town between Wasit and Huzistan. Its people are **Aramaeans**  to this time and their language is **Aramaic** . Dawud ibn Ahmad ibn Sa‘td of at-Tib, the merchant—may God have mercy on him—-said, “It is common knowledge among us that at-Tib was founded by **Seth son of Adam**—peace be upon him—and its people continued to follow the **sect (milla) of Seth, which is the doctrine of the Sabi’a**, until Islam came; then they converted to Islam.”  
  
Al Sahraziri’s history of the philosophers, Nuzhat alarwah wa-rawdat al-afrah, written in the second half of the thirteenth century, uniquely exhibits familiarity with the account that I have attributed here to Ibn Muala in Chapter 6. E. Cottrell deserves credit for intuiting that **a’-Sahraziin's account of the ancient Seth includes details originally connected with Mandaeism.** This is the pdf by Emily Cottrell, ““Mandaean Connections in the Chapters Adam and Seth of Shams al-Dīn al-Shahrazūrī’s Promenade of the Souls”, ARAM Conference on “The Mandaeans,” University of Oxford, 9-11 August 2009, pp. 509-547.”",2024-01-17 14:31:16

We are a Germanic people in origin, and our ancestors migrated from Northern Germany and Southern Denmark (Northern Europe) circa 450ad after the fall of Rome. The Anglo-Saxons were North Sea Germanic people, who over time would mix heavily with Indigenous Britons (like the Welsh and others) thus leading to the modern English genome, which is on average more Briton than Germanic (be it Anglo-Saxon or Norse) Anyhow, English people in particular are Germanic in origin thus they have high levels of Germanic, thus they are thoroughly Northern European.

I was told that it had been reported to the police but that was 1970.  The police department has no records. My grandmother told me that she went to the police and had a lawyer but was told there was nothing they could do because 2 of the guys had went into the military one had his records expunged.

He claims he has no recollection of having any type of encounter with my mother and has no memory of her what so ever.  When he returned home from the military his parents had him all set up to go to college in another state and told him not to come back to our state. He was all set up in a singles apartment second floor over looking a pool.

This all sounds 100% consistent with him being a rapist. 

I know it's a sad truth, but you had no part in it, and it's nothing for you to be ashamed of. Somewhere down the line, most (all?) of us are likely descendants of rape victims and, by the nature of that situation, of rapists as well. 

What makes you who you are is your life, and your biological father has not been a part of it. So no, you're not a product of rape; that event happened before you came into this world, and in most of your formative years you knew nothing of it. You are the sum of your own experiences and your own relationships; the rest is history. And history is good to know, both in general and how we ourselves tie into the story, but no one owns history, we all share it. I would accept this and move on. 

And the grandmother doesn't want to meet you? Put yourself in her shoes, even though that might be very hard to do, what would you do? I'd like to think in such a situation I'd be respectful and want to atone for someone of my own blood.

When I wen to the police department at that time they had me have a seat and about 5 OLDER police officers came out. I felt like they were looking me up and down.

Haiti is the first black republic in the world and after independence they specifically slaughtered the white and mulatto population to try and eradicate them and they only pardoned Polish soldiers who fought for them, which shows in the average ancestry of Haitians as they're the most African of the African diaspora unless you include maroons (descendants of escaped slaves) which generally are about as African as the average Haitian anyways.

l8lon5u,reddit_comment,8,"Bahamian history nerd here! 

There are a few reasons that could be attributed to. Firstly, Indigenous American is a pretty vague term. 

The taino arawak lucayan and caribs spanned across the “Caribbean” especially before boarders were drawn and are all considered indigenous. Depending on your heritage this could be the indigenous tribes they’re referring to. Especially knowing that colonizers “did what they did” many indigenous/colonizer children happened that way… 

Secondly, many British colonialists (and their slaves) left America to settle in British colonies (like The Bahamas) to start plantations which is how a lot of Bahamian families both white and black arrived to the country. Many coming from areas like the Carolina’s which were/are home to several indigenous tribes like the Cherokees (just as an example). It wouldn’t have been completely unheard of that somewhere along the line those genetics also got mixed in (though historically, likely not super consensually)

Without more information it would be hard to pinpoint exactly what tribes or what that really refers to. Especially at 5% you’re looking at a relative quite distant and who would likely account for some… experimentation (for lack of a better word) on one of your ancestors parts.",2024-06-14 16:34:27

lsm1743,reddit_comment,45,"The DNA match itself is not a scam. If 23andMe shows a 26% overlap in DNA, then yes, she's related to your husband. Given the ages, she's most likely a half-sibling.

Not sure why your husband thinks this is a scam, unless he suspects for some reason that she wants to use the relationship as a way to get money from his father. You don't mention whether your father-in-law is still living, but if he is, then he has a right to know about this other child of his.

Whether or not your husband wants to meet his sister is also up to him. Personally, I'd be thrilled to find a bio-sibling (that's one of the main reasons I started taking DNA tests), but apparently not everyone feels that way.

Please urge him not to be too hostile with this woman. Even if he doesn't want anything to do with her, that rejection can be delivered tactfully rather than brutally. There's a potential to inflict emotional wounds by assuming the very worst without even knowing her.",2024-10-19 00:06:34

Now only you know the full details, so you should be able to eliminate the relationships that don’t make sense, like grand parent, grand child and niece based on her age compared to the brothers.   The odds of your husband’s grandparents giving up a child that would be their youngest are probably slim, so she wouldn’t be an aunt. So that just leaves half sibling.

lssq5u8,reddit_comment,1,"You can’t fake a DNA match, because you can’t fake someone’s DNA. The only way your brother in law could have matched with this lady is if he actually shares DNA with her. Now, there are some things that need to be considered in order to determine whose father is whose. Do you know if your brother in law recognizes any other matches or last names that should belong to BOTH his mother’s side of the family AND his father’s side? If the answer is yes to both then it’s more likely your father in law is this lady’s father. HOWEVER, if your brother in law doesn’t find anyone he recognizes from his father’s side of the family and his father isn’t adopted or something then it might be possible that this half sister actually grew up with her biological father and her father is also your brother in law’s father somehow. This is not unheard of. Not to speak ill of your in laws, I don’t know them, I am not saying this happened, but sometimes affairs happen or people use donors to have children and it’s all kept quiet by the parents. And people grow up well into adulthood thinking their parents are their parents until one day they take a DNA test and find out one or both are not. When this happens it is called NPE which stands for not parent expected or non paternal event. It sounds like to me that this half sister thinks maybe she’s had an NPE from what she says. It sounds like she thinks the father she grew up with might not be her father if that’s true then it’s more likely your father in law is her father somehow. The other possibility which she seems to be considering since she doesn’t sound sure is your brother in law is the one with  the NPE and it’s his father that is not the one he grew up with. I think you guys need to get more information by maybe considering having your husband’s dna tested to see if he is his brother’s full sibling or half sibling. If he shows up as a full sibling to your brother in law and the lady as his half sister too then it’s your father in law who fathered her. If your husband shows up as his brother’s half sibling then it’s her father who fathered your brother in law and her. Either way it sounds like someone has an NPE here. When you guys figure it out I recommend looking up NPE support groups on Facebook and other places which people who through this find helpful. There you can talk to others who have gone through this and listen to their stories. They also can point you to resources. There are also podcasts where you can hear peoples stories of similar situations on Apple Podcasts and Spotify and the the like. People talk about when they suspected (if they did), how they found out,  what happened when they tried to connect with relatives etc. I know this whole thing must be a lot to process for all of you but even though it will be hard to come to terms with these things there might be good that comes out of all of this. People who go through this and have found new found family members sometimes become very close to them. On the other hand when people ignore the truth, ignore newfound siblings, children, and parents, there can be a lot of hurt and rejection for those involved.",2024-10-20 04:44:41

My only advice is really to you. Don't take on the entire emotional burden of the fallout. You can't protect anyone -- like your mother-in-law -- from life events, that's simply not within your power. What you can do is support them afterwards. 

Trying to keep this daughter's existence a secret, not telling your in-laws about her, is one option. I tend to think it's not the best option because too many people know now. If, on the other hand, your husband and brothers decide to tell their dad, at least they'll have control over breaking the news to him. 

Your father-in-law then has the option to say no, to ask that his daughter stay away. He can try to keep this secret from his wife. Or he can tell her himself and they can decide how to proceed. All of those choices are HIS responsibility, not yours.",2024-10-19 14:00:43

Hello all. My husband and I recently did our 23 and Me tests. Mine came out as I expected but I was mainly interested in the family tree options and I was hoping this could help fill in some gaps. Low and behold someone just messages me with a close connection. She is adopted and this is her first close contact. She is hoping for a half sibling but as per 23 and Me she is showing as an aunt for me. 

I am just wondering before getting really into this and starting to share info, has anyone heard of people being able to make fake accounts and connections on 23 and Me? I wasn't sure if that was a known problem on the various DNA testing ancestry kits.

Edit: typo

Update: first off, thank you to everyone who has shared advice and info. I have always appreciated this subs community even though I was only casually doing my ancestry currently. I was finally able to figure out our cM  on 23 and me and it's 1974cM! So far in our convo it looks like its adding up she is my half sibling on my father's side. She was born at a known ""birthing house"" for young mothers and immediately went into foster care. Her mom believes the bio mom came from X city and guess where my dad grew up... I also had my fathers birth year wrong from some of my comments below, and he would have been 18 and was just leaving for the military so probably didn't even know she was conceived/born. Guess I need to have a talk with my dad. This has been a day!

Update #2: for those that have asked for an update after talking to my dad. I called tonight and let him know what I have been working through all day. He had no idea and no one ever approached him back in the day about a potential child. In his words ""my mind is blown"". Obviously this is a lot to process and my father is not one to make rush decisions. Right now my parents are wintering down south, so won't be back for a month and has asked for that time to process and we will look at everything when he gets back home.

FYI, 23andMe is not well geared for doing genealogy. They only made a half-assed attempt at putting in a family tree making facility a couple of years ago. The vast majority of your matches on there will not have trees.

It's important to be on 23andMe to capture as many of your DNA matches as possible, but Ancestry are light years ahead of 23andMe when it comes to actually doing genealogy.

hysoujn,reddit_comment,12,"As people say, you can't fake the DNA. But someone who is labeled as your niece or nephew could really be a half-sibling, and vice versa. As people replying to you here have already explained, both relationships carry about the same amount of shared DNA -- so I think it is pretty clear that 23andme is also relying on age difference when it makes this call as to what the relationship is. It assumes if the age difference is considerable, that the relationship is aunt/uncle to niece/nephew. But that is not always the case. There is sometimes a great deal of age difference between siblings in a family. So you have to take further steps to clarify the actual relationship yourself. 

For me, someone who was listed as my nephew on 23andme was actually a half-sibling 16 years younger than myself. I suspected the existence of this individual so I had a head start in figuring out the real relationship between us. It wasn't a complete shock out of the blue for me, it was more like the shock of recognition which is different.

For all the criticism leveled above, Ancestry's tools are really only helpful if you already have a tree to work from. 23andMe's ""half-assed"" tree is generated algorithmically from close ancestors and again helps quite a bit with triangulation.

And I'm speaking as someone who was able to reverse engineer the identity of my maternal grandfather using nothing but triangulation of 23andMe matches.

I wouldn't have been able to do that with AncestryDNA's tools. But once I did get enough of a tree and information going, testing on Ancestry definitely helped. Between the two I have an almost complete tree, starting from zero knowledge (adopted).

At that time your could use a company called Genetic Affairs to run clusters on your Ancestry DNA matches and get your triangulation that way. Unfortunately Ancestry no longer allow them to do that, so my timing was good.

After the year with Ancestry I decided to test with 23andMe. I expected something along the same lines as my experience with Ancestry. I was severely disappointed. None of my matches had trees. There was no tree making facility on 23andMe at all at that time. There was no way to group your matches. So what you ended up with was just a long list of names. I spent a couple of days on the site and then left. I didn't return for several months.

I log back in now when I get a new match notification. I look to see if any of them have trees. They don't. I log back out again in less than 5 minutes.

The cM range for Aunt on 23andMe is 1264 - 2529 cM. Even on the low end of that, there are really only a few relationships it can be. Half-siblings share a very similar amount of DNA to full aunts. 

You should be able to compare common matches to determine which side she is related to, and based on that, you should be able to narrow down if she is more likely to be an Aunt, half-sibling, or something else.

I have some experience with this. My birth parents were 16 when I was born. My youngest half-sibling is 16 years younger than me.

In the largest genetic study of its kind to date, 23andMe scientists have identified variants associated with an increased risk of developing Long COVID and also established a genetic link between the potentially debilitating condition and other chronic conditions such as depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia.

For the most statistically significant genetic association (rs9273363), the increased risk of getting LC was 6%.  That's not nothing, but it is a small effect.   Interestingly, the risk variant (a C instead of an A) is *protective* against developing Type 1 diabetes, a well established autoimmune disease.  The protective effect against Type 1 Diabetes is larger than its risk effect in LC.  The ""C"" risk variant is quite common, with 37% of folks with European ancestry having it, 46% of folks with Han Chinese ancestry, and 39% of folks with Japanese ancestry.   (side note, I am heterozygous for this risk, with one A and one C)  

[https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs9273363](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs9273363)

The other most significant variants they found were all protective against LC, although these effect sizes were similarly quite small.

What is more interesting to me is what they didn't find.  For example, they did not find that APOE-e4 was a risk for LC, nor were the risk genes for Parkinson's nor other neuroinflammatory / neurodegenerative diseases.  This adds to the evidence that the mechanisms of LC are not the same as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and the rest.",2024-10-23 01:55:18

kc9do9y,reddit_comment,2,"1. 23andme wasn’t involved in Golden state killer case. Some of his distant relatives uploaded their personal DNA data (not sure which DTC genetic company) to a website called GED match. GED match claims that you can upload your data from 23andme, Ancestry, MyHeritage etc, the company aggregates the data for free and shows relatives across their entire database. GED match however has no policy stating they will not share data with law enforcement. So law enforcement uploaded golden state killer DNA data to GED match and they found distant relatives, enough to create a family tree and catch the killer. 

2. Signing up for 23andme does not automatically allow them to share your data with pharma companies or do research on that. There are two separate “OPT-IN” consent forms that you have to sign: first to allow 23andme do their own internal research using your data, and second to allow 23andme share your anonymized data with third parties like pharma companies. Further, you can opt out of these consents any time you like, it literally takes 2 clicks since I have done that before. You can also choose to have your data deleted anytime you like, which is also a super simple process. Given all these checks in place, I can confidently say that people are well aware what they are opting into, unlike what some people incorrectly assume.",2023-12-06 18:42:08
kcaqmoz,reddit_comment,2,"It is millions of people using reusing passwords.


This is how the attack works:

1. Some hacker(s) hack into a small company or companies who have terrible security and stores passwords ether in plain text or with really weak encryption.

2. Those hackers sell the password+email combinations and someone will purchase it. 

3. They try all billions of these password+email combinations to try to log into 23&me. 

4. A program downloads all the data they can get from the portal. (Raw DNA data needs to be requested and has a few days of turn around, they also just email it to you, so not in the portal)

5. Sell the data scraped for more then the list cost to purchase. 


The issue is people used the same password on a site that had bad security. 

The only way a company can fight against this on their side is two factor as the one time password is not duplicate.

The company could also try to make it more difficult by flagging IP addresses that try to log into more than a few accounts, but VPNs can get around that fairly easily. 

The reason the raw DNA was not obtained was because it is not on the portal, and it can't be downloaded from it, you request it and then they email it to you. (In this case effectively making your email a second factor of authentication) 

The janky part is that it is annoying and slow to get the raw data if you want to process it yourself. Their email system is secure, just slow to the point it seems like it is a manual system. 


In the end it really wasn't 23&me that got hacked it was some other company and people having bad security practices. 23&me is not blameless, they definitely should have required people to have 2FA with data as sensitive as this. 

It is worse because that likely means those people hit reused their passwords elsewhere so they may be hit again if they don't change their passwords.",2023-12-06 23:49:11

2019 is not ""recent"".

I am subscribed to the ""DNA Relatives"" feature, and got a request from someone for a connection; I accepted the request, and the person has close to 40% of my DNA in common.

Under ""Likely relationship"" between this person and me, it says ""Grandson"". Thing is, I never had kids and I never saved/froze/whatever any embryos.

Then I got a message from the person wanting to know another relative's name. And that's it, no ""hi how are you"", no explanation, just the question, that's it, one sentence. Is this some kind of weird scam or hack or something? I kind of freaked out and blocked the person without saying anything.

At this point, I really don't know what to think. Scam? Hack? Bug? I mean, I would definitely remember if I had a child, lol, let alone a grandchild!

**Edited to add, days later:** I learned from this thread that the ""Grandson"" thing isn't written in stone, and the DNA match level could also refer to being an aunt/uncle/niece/nephew/half-sibling, so thanks for that. I also learned that some people feel really strongly about DNA relatives being important. I guess I just don't feel that way. I feel like they are total strangers, who have an equal chance of being good people or completely dysfunctional/unstable.

There’s really no chance they’re anything less than a parent or sibling (unless due to inbreeding).

The whole platform is set up to DNA test and match relatives, that's the point, it's not like they've called you on your home phone, they've messaged you on a platform where they assumed you were open to finding out about family members and understanding DNA links. 

You have definitely been DNA matched with a very close relative and when they've sent you a brief message you've blocked them, maybe they should have explained more but it doesn't really justify your reaction to block and think it's a scam. Why not at least engage? You seem defensive and in denial that you could be related. The close matches are *never* wrong, otherwise there would be a huge scandal and people wouldn't trust it. 

You haven't even paid enough attention to this person to remember the DNA match percent. 36-38% is not a 'normal' range for a relationship. If anything this is in the perfect range for a 3/4 sibling (one shared parent and other parent is your aunt/uncle) but that would be speculation, anything slightly higher could even be a full sibling, and lower than 33/34% could be an aunt/uncle/grandparent/half-sibling.

d82q72c,reddit_comment,34,"So none of these answers have really addressed the 'how' part of these services and I feel like that was the bulk of the question so I will give it my best shot. Full disclaimer: my genetics is a bit rusty but the principles are still solid. I do not know exactly what each of these services offers to tell you but I would imagine they reveal information in three categories: disease risk, carrier status of certain diseases, and 'ancestry' info concerning what part of the world you may be from. 

To begin the test you submit a sample of your DNA via a saliva sample and some lab tech somewhere will extract your DNA by lysing the cells and then one of a few things could happen. I would expect that one of two things happens:

1) They sequence your full genome. This would entail putting the extracted DNA into an automated sequencer that identifies the order that your DNA is in by building the 'chains' on a plate with 'blocks' that have colored 'tags' that a computer eye can read. A computer with an optic sensor assembles a chain that is complementary (not identical, basically a mirrored copy that the original can be deduced from) to your original DNA sequence and then reads that chain one color at a time. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOxUS8QAxwI) The technology here is staggering and improves every day but I would be shocked if they fully sequence your genome, a lot of the full human genome is poorly understood so it would be a lot of info with little application. This topic could be covered in a full college course so I won't linger. Instead....

2) They isolate and amplify interesting regions that have been linked to certain traits of diseases. Using a technique like PCR a lab tech can basically photocopy portions of your DNA that are interesting and then sequence only those regions. PCR works by using template strands that bind to known regions and then copying everything that comes after them. Again, the process of PCR was revolutionary and the tech is really incredible. Just know that PCR lets a researcher isolate and copy targeted pieces of your DNA. By sequencing the DNA we just copied we now have an ordered sequence of DNA that can be kicked up the line for analysis.

So now that we know the sequence of the DNA we can try to determine exactly what it means. Determining carrier status or affliction of certain diseases is relatively straightforward for many ailments: a researcher looks at your sequence, determines if you have certain  copies of certain alleles (a piece of a gene), and compares those alleles to know sequences of diseased individuals. The simplest system here will be a system where 'normal' is two healthy alleles (ZZ), carrier is one normal and one diesease (ZY), and diseased is two disease alleles (YY). The process of determining carrier status is relatively simple so I would imagine these conclusions are relatively reliable. 

As to disease risk and prevalence I would be very cautious in drawing many conclusions from their reports. In order to assess for these criteria I would imagine a tech would compare certain portions of your genome to a large database and attempt to correlate repeated sequences with known diseases. The presence or absence of certain genes can sometimes be linked to certain diseases but scientists often disagree on how much these things actually correlate. For example, the presence of a certain sequence has been linked with a higher incidence of breast cancer in individuals with that sequence. So, services like 23andMe initially sent out reports informing people with that gene that they were at an increased risk of said cancer. However, this linkage was poorly understood and statements like 'presence of the x23 gene reveal a 25% increased risk of cancer' are far from accurate and really do not stand up to scrutiny. This practice actually lead to some legal action in the early days of these services and companies were ordered to change the way they informed patients. Take any statements of disease risk with a grain of salt, for anything other than true genetic diseases there are a plethora of factors that create an individuals risk of disease. The company that can accurately determine my disease profile from my DNA will be bigger than Microsoft.

Finally, in order to determine something like ancestry or kinship I would imagine they examine the genome for regions that are conserved within communities. Within your genome their are portions of repeated DNA that appear with frequency for certain groups so I would imagine that this forms the basis for their assumptions. Certain breeding populations have developed characteristic regions within their genome that would indicate certain levels of isolation and therefor kinship/ancestry. For instance, people from Japan could have 3 different regions of 100 bases that are shared by most of the population on the island but not found in non-natives, allowing someone in the US to determine that they are 66% Japanese if 2/3 of regions are present. However, I would again caution against taking their analysis as fact because lots of really funny things happen when genetics are examined on a population level. We know that the variation between isolated groups is often less than the variation within those same groups, meaning an African man might be genetically more similar to Italians than another group of Africans. Population genetics is a whole field of study in and of itself so I won't even claim to understand all the nuances.

The study of genetics and the implications of your genome are insanely complex topics that are still truly in their infancy. With the advent of modern computers we are just now getting to where we can reliably sequence an entire genome in a reasonable time frame, the application of that sequence is an even newer field that is still emerging and relatively poorly understood. For passing interest these tests can be very interesting but I would seriously hesitate to claim some percentage of ancestry or disease risk as fact.

The results confirmed everything that I researched and it was REALLY interesting. I traced my family as far back as the 900's. Just having the DNA kit topped it off. 

Also with the DNA kit, they match you up with anyone who has taken the test as well. They can compare you to people and see how closely related you are. As far as 6th cousin. I had 600+ potential relatives. About 3-4 were 1st-2nd cousins according to Ancestry.

She ended up contacting a person with her father's last name through this service who turned out to be an aunt (her father's sister).

d82txwl,reddit_comment,3,"I wouldn't think they use whole-genome sequencing as this is somewhat expensive and unnecessary. They are likely using a combination of PCR and ""shotgun sequencing"" to isolate, amplify, and sequence specific regions of the human genome that contain a lot of genetic markers like single-nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellites.

A lot of Genome Wide Association Studies have been done with large pedigrees in certain populations to provide insight into these genetic markers, and it is likely that they can use these studies and their own data to make inferences on ancestral history and disease risk. Depending on the disease, information from simple genetic markers could actually be quite accurate -- they are based on the principles of linkage, and at this point there is quite a bit of data for the more common diseases. 

Of course the disease risk would likely be given as a percentage, and unfortunately no matter how accurate this percentage is, the human mind tends to struggle with the concept of statistics sometimes.

I read somewhere a few months ago an article about DNA testing kits (actually against these DNA tests because of privacy concerns -- who is able to buy this data? what if insurance companies know you're at risk for heart disease? Could they raise your premiums?). This article had cited sources that these DNA testing companies (I think 23 & Me in particular) had collected enough data that they could make predictions that GWAS had not (related to eye colour and other things).

d83bn06,reddit_comment,3,"You don't have to speculate, both ancestry and 23 and me use microarrays.  They hybridize pieces of your DNA to different templates that contain common variants and detect which version your DNA binds to, the one with the variant or without.  You forgot a subset of 1 which is a targeted sequencing, either exome or custom designed for variants they are looking for.  Those are bad for doing something like ancestry, exomes are much better for doing something like disease.  
You are being way too harsh and a little wrong on interpretation.  There are lots of genetic changes that we are confident are causing disease or conferring risk.  *but* it is very limited.  23 and me got in trouble because they are not a licensed medical group, you need people with certifications like genetic counselors conveying this information.  For what you can be certain about look up the the ACMG incidental findings guidelines.  These are genes with well characterized variation where there is an actionable medical action that can be taken, so they are routinely communicated to patients, if they want to know about them.  BRCA2 is one of those 56 genes.  If you have a loss of function variant in BRCA2 you have a much higher risk of cancer.   
For ancestry you are farther off, the variation that arises in the population is for the most part random (because for the most part it does not affect fitness).  That means that variation arises and then is spread throughout a population.  Repeats are actually much more variable and change a lot more, these ancestry comparisons are done on single nucleotide variants.  You got the fact right, that an african can be more genetically similar to an italian than a distant african, but you forgot the conclusion.  That is because there is much more variation within Africa.  That african and italian *are* more related than the two africans.",2016-09-26 23:08:24

d8316md,reddit_comment,1,"Yeah, I really just included whole genome sequencing because I think that is where the market is headed. With the falling prices of hardware it is pretty cheap to sequence your whole genome so I think that combined with a user-friendly bioinformatics system will be the next big trend. My question, though, is how do they toss around numbers like 22% Scandinavian or 2% British? Sure, SNP's and other markers can tell me where I am similar to sequences from a certain region but that does not necessarily mean I have actual relatives from that area. A commenter in this thread has like 1% South African or something, what the heck is that based on? Okay, I have a SNP that matches someone from SA, that does not mean my lineage has African members. I'm concerned that these companies are making gross generalizations to drive profits without really telling people what they are seeing.

d82l2yo,reddit_comment,4,"If you're paranoid, is there a phrasing of a guarantee that would make you comfortable?

When you have a test done it just associates a sample with an email, and that email doesn't have to be associated with your main account (and your name) if you don't want it to.

They could track that you paid for it, and they sent you sample X, so they know that sample will be you, but that is only reliable if you actually use it yourself and not buy it for a family member.

You can get the raw info from Ancestry, and you can also request it be deleted, and they say they can't recover it if you request that.

Long answer; not a biologist or anything, but I have used lab equipment for a geology master's degree. The equipment we used was really fragile in terms of proper sample prep. Data could very quickly become meaningless, scrambled, or the machine could break. 

I figured the first test failure was a fluke (clearly so did they because they sent a second pack!). Had I known I'm one of the unlucky few I may have considered some cheek tissue yeah. Hopefully it wouldnt have broken the machine(s) though!

Hi everyone, my mother did a 23andme test and it came back with a surprise 13.3 % Norwegian ancestry.

lyq3f68,reddit_comment,1,"Haplogroups are like a ""stamp"" that everyone's DNA gets, some kind of signature that is passed down from generation to generation. There are many but to some extent, they are registered.

There are two kinds, one that is only passed down by men, and another one that is passed down by women. Women get the feminine one only, men get both (but only pass down the masculine).

Due to that nature and inheritance, for example a woman shares her ""women's"" haplogroup (mitochondrial) with her mother, her maternal grandmother, and all the women in that line up from her mother's tree. Same thing for a man and his ""men's"" haplogroup (Y), he shares it with his father and all the men following that line up.

It's also useful to see ancient migrations, because knowing where they originated, scientists can draw a route people followed through the years. The same way people in USA nowadays have haplogroups in common with people in Europe and Africa (obviously), the first people that went to the Americas (natives) also shared haplogroups with East Asian people.

Haplogroups can change slightly through history though, through mutations. So the natives ""developed"" their own haplogroups.",2024-11-24 11:10:14

1dx6vli,reddit_post,6,"Data is too valuable for 23andMe to get delisted.  Tell me why I shouldn't go all in.

I'm thinking of doing a YOLO play....help me find the reasons I shouldn't. 

According to Fintel “a company with a Value Score of 100 would be the most undervalued company in our database. A company with a Value Score of zero would be the most overvalued.”   Their valuation score of 23 and Me:  ~99.74~

23andMe's is down 75% over the last year and was issued a notice of noncompliance putting the company at risk for delisting, however in May of this year, they were granted a 180 day extension have until November to get into compliance. 

The two most likely scenarios are a private equity sale or reverse split. A reserve split would overcome the risk of delisting,  but not  funding for majority owner/founder Ms. Wojcicki’s desire for the company to focus is on personalized medicine and therapeutic solutions through genetics. In April, she stared she wanted to take the company private and would seek financing sources. Yet months later an announcement was made that on 08/26/24, the board will recommend shareholders to vote for a reverse split. 

I think a buy out is more likely due who the institutional shareholders and Ancestry’s deal taking the company from public to private. 

An investor that owns more than 5% and files a 13D which  indicates that they want to actively pursue a change in business strategy.  On  01/26/24, BlackRock Inc filed a 13D, becoming the largest shareholder, owning 7.20% of the company. On 02/13/24, BlackRock’s buddy investor Vanguard filed their 13D with the SEC, becoming 7% owner.  The vote on 08/26/24 won’t matter, these three entities have more than enough shares to control the outcome of the vote. 

About  4 years ago, BlackStone bought Ancestry for a whopping ~$4.7 billion~ , for 75% stake, a deal that took the company from public to private. Shareholders were paid $32.05 a share. I understand the differences between the two companies and their financial standings, but it hard to image that this company would simply go bust and delist. At .43 cents right now, it seems like a safe bet and that some type of catalyst is going to happen between now October. 

Edit: forgot I wanted to add that their chief financial officer just bought 1 million shares. Being the CFO, I believe he is inclined to know the financial future of this company. ",2024-07-07 03:14:06

So I got my results back today. Now before everyone shits on me, it was an impulsive decision during a meltdown that I ordered 23and me… I know I should’ve gone for ancestry instead.

But here’s the thing. I did the test trying to find out who my biological parents are. So I went in with 0 expectations. And today I got my results back and I have over 80 distant relatives. And 0 close ones.

How do I approach them or do I approach them?

I’ve been in a really bad place for a few years now overthinking about this whole thing.

What do you guys suggest?",2024-05-13 19:53:33

Sorry you've been in a bad place. If you're an adoptee, I would also try finding adoptee only support groups. I think it's important that you're in a good place mentally before contacting relatives. With a DNA search angel, they will help guide you. I'm unsure if they would need you to reach out to your distant relatives for more info, but maybe you won't need to contact anyone yet. But when you find youe bio family, I think it's important to be feeling as comfortable as possible with the process as you can.

l3xc2dv,reddit_comment,2,"Finding your relations is harder if they are in a low testing population, but you may find more matches over time as any aunts or uncles or half siblings or cousins, or their children or grandchildren test as time goes by. 

Also I recommend you turn off DNA matches. 

When you come back to check it later, you turn it back on and see if closer matches exist, but in the meantime nobody sees your test, and hides their DNA matches because they are freaked out by something they did not know. If you're hidden temporarily you will get to see if new tests match when you turn it back on later, take screenshots and save the information on that relative and either send them a message and see what happens, or turn off matches again if they're a distant relation.

It's not awful if you don't because not everyone is going freak out when they see your match, it just makes it possible that some close matches are kind of stealthed until you log in and turn matches back on.",2024-05-13 23:29:37

If I was in your position I’d 100% order an Ancestry test right now and go after those results, haha! I was also adopted and found my family via DNA tests. As you can tell, I am a huge advocate, haha
I also feel like Ancestry users tend to reply more to messages than 23andMe users. It might have something you do with the layout of the app and website for 23andMe - messages suck through 23andMe as they show up as “notifications” not “messages” so a lot of people don’t even realize you tried to send them a message.

lqf2e0l,reddit_comment,2,"A way to check: 

Go through your list of shared matches (Ancestry is easier for this). Take note, are they from your grandfather's side or grandmother's side? If they're all your grandmother's side for example, you almost certainly are half cousins (excluding situations where one of your grandparents is from a population that doesn't test/isn't in the US/very recent immigrant from a country that doesn't test).

On the other hand if you're going through and the first person, a second cousin is on your grandmother's side and the next down a third cousin is on your grandfather's side and the next as well, and the one after is your grandmother's side again..... you can safely conclude you simply share a very low amount of DNA for a full cousin.",2024-10-05 05:55:59

jrhz004,reddit_comment,3,"I’ve looked at both subs and tbh I disagree, the thing is that ancestry breaks it down more clearly so it looks more accurate to some, but their divisions are a bit weird sometimes. Why I disagree though is because on Ancestry almost everyone with Northwestern European ancestry gets some Scottish on Ancestry, even if they’ve got none. This is not just for Scottish though, in general I find that Ancestry seems to assign results from places inaccurately a lot more than 23andme (which only really happens for noise percentages that are less than 1% whereas in Ancestry it could be like 3 or 4%, like I seen Portuguese results on 23rd me showing 99% Portuguese with 1% trace North African which sounds very accurate but then on Ancestry they might have 2% Ireland 2% Cyprus which is very likely false. A worse one is one I’ve seen for someone from southwestern France that get 13% Scotland when on 23andme they got none, and have no record of Scottish at all.

The worst Ancestry is for Northwestern Europeans are for people from Brittany who usually gets results with over 30% Scottish and 30% Irish when they’ve got none at all,  just because they are descended from Celts from Britain which are genetically similar to people from Ireland and Scotland. Though tbh 23andme gives them a British score as well just that they don’t specify where in Britain, which can be at least seen as quite accurate as in general Bretons especially from Western Brittany are genetically British but from Cornwall, and not from Scotland and Ireland. 

The reason btw that you get Spanish and Portuguese on 23andme but not ancestry is cos French reference is skewed to the North for 23andme, so southern French is seen as partially Iberian, (which I guess you could say is a large miss-assigning but at least it makes sense as people from Southern France would seem to be partially Iberian when the French reference is from Northern France to group it better when Germanic Europe, whereas the Ireland results I sometimes see for Iberians is just completely inaccurate. Reversely on Ancestry the French reference is skewed to the south, if you look at a map of Ancestry results the French map misses like half of France (which I think looks really dumb) and is mainly mapped over Southern France, so people from Northern France that are fully French sometimes only score like 60% French (to the very north even lower, sometimes only like 20% French) and the rest mostly the England and Northwestern Europe category which is quite arbitrary though I see some reasoning to it, but it’s a poor categorisation for someone interested in where they are from.

I don’t know the case as well from places apart from Western Europe though.",2023-07-11 04:50:04

1jy9c1o,reddit_post,10,"Update: ""Stillborn son"" 23 and Me saga

Last year my cousin connected with a man that was had a 25% relation on her father's side. Indicating that he was an uncle. 

A lot has happened since and we are still working on what's what of this whole situation. 

So for starters the gentleman is the half brother of who is now my half uncle (formerly my full uncle and my cousin's father). My grandmother had an affair that resulted in my uncle and this man is the brother in this. (This man also has no relationship with his father evidently. 

We do have a hunch about who the father is but we have no way of confirming the information.

Within a few months (about 3 months ago) of taking a series of direct DNA tests, 23andMe updated the relationship to verify that he is a half uncle of my cousin. So all of the drama for nothing I guess? 

My grandmother is still unaware of this information, she is also losing most of her memory so I don't think she will ever find out. We also have not completely informed my uncle of this information either. He has no computer, or phone or anything really. The results of this came to my email and I haven't been able to contact my uncle yet about it. 

Thanks for all of the support. We are still working on getting the burial locations of all of my grandmother's babies. There were apparently four of them and we still only have records for one. I have learned a lot about the adoption industry in the process, especially what happened to the impoverished families and hope that others have as well.

1iyq55d,reddit_post,2,"How can someone find their birth father through 23andme familial connections?

Hello everyone, 

I have a question for y’all, but I want to give some background history before I ask it. I am a 36-year-old female who was adopted at birth from Tijuana, Mexico. A few years back, I did a 23 and Me test that resulted in me being able to get into contact with a super distant relative. Through them and some notes I found that my adoptive mother kept, I was able to locate my younger half-sister (to find out we grew up only 30 minutes away from each other in California). After contacting my younger sister, I was able to identify my birth mother and three other half-sisters. My three older sisters live in Mexico and were raised by different family members. My birth mother has hopped back and forth between Mexico and Los Angeles for years. However, she currently works for a very successful person in Los Angeles who is in “the industry.’ My birth mother raised my youngest sister for the first half of her childhood, then eventually left her with her dad. Upon my mother finding out that I was getting in contact with family, she attempted to deny my relation to her. But after some more digging and speaking with other family members, it was confirmed that I am her daughter. Now, I have gotten to know some of my birth family and become close with my younger sister. However, I have yet to meet my mother. It appears my mother does not want to tell the truth about how she came to have me and why I was the only one she put up for adoption. At this point, I have heard numerous odd stories from her and the family about the circumstances of my birth and subsequent adoption. And nobody seems to know what the truth is. I am not sure any of us will ever know the truth. So now I am on a mission to try to contact my father’s side of the family. My birth mother refuses to tell me who he is but says that he is a “powerful person” in Mexico. While this could just be another one of her fanciful stories, I still would like to find out who my father is and if he wants a relationship with me, hence why I have come here to ask this question. In your cumulative knowledge, can I use my 23 and Me results to track down my father/his side of the family? I figure there must be a way to isolate all the results coming from my mother’s lineage and focus on my father’s ancestry. Maybe from there, I can narrow down who he is and possibly locate him. Does this sound doable? And if so, how do you all suggest I start the process?

I think Genotek is the most popular one.

I mean that instead of the broad ""Eastern Europe"" indicator they specify whether you are Russian/Belarusian/Ukrainian, Tatar/Bashkir, Chuvash, Ashkenazi Jewish, etc etc.

You can also download raw data to analyze or, for an additional fee, convert it into 23andmeV3 format to upload to GEDmatch, MyHeritage etc.

And you can upload third-party data (from Altas, 23andMe, FamilyTreeDNA, MyHeritage, Ancestry) to Genotek.

23andme uses a sample of people as a reference for each population. For their Levantine population they typically use Levantine Christians as they have been homogenous in the area for the past 2000 years or so.

If you don't show Levantine it likely stems from having a genetic distance from the current reference groups.

I 100% can absolutely verify with records that I have Mexican ancestry. I've got marriage records for my 3rd great-grandparents. My dad grew up in a bilingual household speaking English and Spanish. My maiden name is very obviously a Spanish surname, and my grandmother has an EXTREMELY common Spanish surname; think something along the lines of ""Smith"". My dad at one point found the gateway ancestor from Spain, but lost the info. Gateway ancestor in this means the first person with my maiden name recorded being in the Americas. I'm phrasing it that way because they came over from Spain in the 1530s, and they settled in the area that's now known as Cameron County, Texas within a 50-mile radius.  


My heritage suggests that I'm something like 30% Italian. I have no Italian relatives, I have no Italian ancestry. With that large of a percentage, I would have to have a full Italian grandparent. I 100% absolutely do not have an Italian grandparent. None of my distant relatives on 23 and me have a drop of Italian ancestry.

4e5wfr,reddit_post,131,"CMV: Blood donors should get a tax deduction *and* something like 23andMe.

In the U.S. at least, a blood donor may get a T-shirt, maybe a card for a free appetizer at a nearby restaurant.  The 'unit' of blood then becomes a basis for medical billing on others, maybe separated into components and sold to 'for-profit' hospital corporations.  

Seems like I, as a donor, should get a 'fair market value' ($100?) tax deduction, just as though I had given money to the GOP or something; OR a membership / free DNA text similar to 23-and-me.  

I do not like 'sticks' (venipuncture) and it seems redundant to donate and then a few days / weeks later go to a doctor who then draws a few phials *more* for his own independent purposes *and bills me for it*.  

Presumably, donors can't be given cash because this would attract drug-users and others at high risk for blood-borne pathogens, which somehow can't be screened out using modern techniques.  These proposals allow attracting donors with higher-value incentives, which are nevertheless not cash, and therefore difficult to exchange for evil drugs.  

I suppose it could be a changed view if you propose *other* incentives which might get people to donate.

d1xa8bx,reddit_comment,66,"The high risk donors are not just a few drug addicts.  They exist in every social class, pay taxes, and respond to long term incentives.  The way we keep our blood pool safe is to rely on volunteers.  We try to avoid situations where people sell blood as well as situations where people feel peer pressure to donate.  We avoid permitting family members to donate for fear that they might be high risk yet feel pressured to donate by their family.  In some centers we have/had a box directing the center to secretly discard your blood to protect us from high risk donors caught up in high-pressure blood drives.  

Adding incentives to donate is a huge mistake.  The ideal situation is to verbally encourage people to donate out of purely charitable motives.  If we are going to spend government money it should go to opening more convenient donation centers, advertising campaigns, and other such measures that offer no incentive whatsoever to donate if you are a potentially risky donor.",2016-04-10 14:34:55

d1xfig8,reddit_comment,8,"If that's the case, I should get a tax deduction for administering others blood to those who need it.  And since I have a medical excuse for being unable to donate, I should get the same deductions.  

Here's the real thing.  Blood has a short half life and cannot be stored for any great period.  This is why during disasters there are campaigns for great blood donations than usual.  In addition, the cost to process and filter the blood into the correct blood components, as well as the cost to pay the personnel to obtain the donations, and the transportation and storage.  I know you think this should be paid by the patients receiving, but you're adding more costs to the healthcare system that doesn't need to be.  Blood collection is largely done by non-profit organizations which tend to be just funded enough so doors don't close.

I understand the concept of being rewarded for civic duties but you just don't.  You don't get rewarded for voting except for helping vote people in who care about the citizens of this nation and not just themselves.

d1z6cpt,reddit_comment,2,"As a tax-preparer I should know this, but this is one I actually had to to look up.

The IRS does not consider giving blood to tax deductible because they consider it to be donating a service rather than a good. Donating your time/services is not tax deductible, because it is nearly impossible to put a value on it.

As for which one donating blood should be, I see both sides, but I think the IRS's interpretation is reasonable. Because you're basically donating your body while they use it for stuff, the fact that you leave with less bodily fluids than you came in with is sort of irrelevant. Not to mention that it's hard to pin down ""fair market value"" of blood.

Now things get very complicated/interesting if you actually extracted and bagged up the blood yourself and then donated that. I don't know the answer to that, as obscure subjects like that don't get many tax publications written on them. Also, you are normally limited to your basis (usually the amount you paid for it) for how much you can take as a deduction. Because you never paid money for your blood, you may not get any deduction for it. It doesn't really matter though, pretty I'm fairly sure no blood bank would ever accept a donation like that.

However, I am almost certain that if you purchased a quantity of blood from some kind of ""blood wholesaler"" and then donated that to charity, it would be deductible, if such a thing existed.

To summarize, blood is never going to be deductible unless it's entirely clear that you are donating a physical good with monetary value and not your time/services, or unless the IRS changes the rules and makes an exception in the case of blood.

I agree with OP there should be some sort of compensation, especially for lengthier procedures like platelet donation.  From start to finish, the process takes me about 2.5 hours, alternating between pain at the needle site and nausea from the anticoagulent. ",2016-04-10 15:52:29

The issue is that there is a window where a test won't show positive, but the blood is infected.  It's extremely rare due to the safeguards that are in place, but it does happen.

A situation that happened to another blood bank:

Donor comes in and donates like they do every 56 days for whole blood.  Unit goes off to be tested before transfusion.  Unit tests positive for HIV, so the unit is discarded, and the regulatory wheels start spinning.  Donor is called to come in to be told (they don't tell you over the phone), and hospital services starts researching past units that were donated.

Turns out, the donor's last unit tested negative and was transfused into the patient. They HIV test the patient, and it comes back positive.  Her unit was infected, but she was in the latency phase where you're infected but don't test positive.

After the interview with the on-staff doctors, it comes out that she donated every 56 days for a ""free STD test"".

Overall, super shitty situation, but thankfully it's rare.  Increasing incentives, especially monetary ones, would further encourage people engaged in risky behavior for donating as well as lying about it on the questionnaire.",2016-04-10 16:57:45
d1xdmme,reddit_comment,10,">I often get calls asking me to donate. Further, I am CMV negative, so they call me any time a newborn needs platelets. I promise you, I feel pressure to donate.

That's not what they mean by peer pressure.  It's just some guy on the phone.  If you were hooking up with people in bars, you'd feel free to ignore all those phone calls.  But what if your brother or friend was telling you to donate?  You don't want to let them know about your sketchy personal behavior, and maybe that's more important to you than keeping our blood supply safe.  I mean you always use a condom anyway, and they test the blood, right?  That's the situation they want to avoid.

>What high-risk behaviors could contaminate blood that aren't routinely tested for? Don't they test my blood for hiv every time?

Drug use especially IV, sex with new partners especially men, travel to high risk countries, etc.  Yes, they test the blood for HIV.  No, that's not good enough.  False negative rates can be up to 1% and we're trying to keep our blood supply way safer than that. The chances of contracting HIV from a blood transfusion is less than 1 in a million, and keeping it there means that relying on blood testing is not good enough.  Not to mention other diseases.

It is paid for by the patients' insurance (or the public for those without insurance).  That's only for the blood that reaches the patients.  Millions of units of blood expires before it can reach a patient.  Blood is only good for 40 days.  So no, you can't get a tax credit otherwise we're giving money out for things which might not be used.  Plasma doesn't go to any person ever and it lasts far much longer so you can get paid for that.

Here's a misconception I think you might be having as well.  You're wanting the government to pay you.  The government doesn't make money, it collects it (for the most part).  So you're looking for the general public to pay for this tax credit.  And taxes or tax cuts will occur proportionately so the tax credit can exist.  So you and everyone is paying for it.  And those who medically can't donate, do I then get a pass on the increase in taxes or do I just get a tax credit for my theoretical limit of donation if I could donate blood?

You might argue your donation could be tracked to see if a patient received it, but then that is a HIPAA issue.  Blood is tracked but from the donor point in case of incident with a transfusion so that donors blood may be 'recalled' in such event.",2016-04-10 20:58:03

Isn't it extremely rare to transmit HIV in cases like these?  Up front, let me be clear that I don't know.  Do people in the 'latency' phase test negative because their viral load is so low? Is this comparable to a 'undetectable' HIV-positive person?

It is a sad situation - it seems like as a society we should offer free STI testing, to avoid this perverse incentive.

hsbvotp,reddit_comment,2,"This the ancient G25 calculator? What does it look like for modern? 

From the study link I posted 

The Fulani from Ziniaré in Burkina Faso have ancestry fractions of 74.5% West African, 21.4% European and 4.1% East African origin.

That's out of a selection of 53 individuals that had their genome analyzed. I kind of have to side with the study. Vahaduo and the calculators are good but they don't have a large sample size to get a read for what the average population admixture breakdown would be. Not to mention it's relying on proxies(Kindoki Congo) that dont reflect the ancient population in the region of West Africa. They form a subset being that they are Bantu. The Bantu diverged from West Africans. Both have admixture they may not be found in the other. So there is that. Not to mention the Ibermauresian depending on how you look at it could add to the SSA just as much as it could lessen it being that the Ibermauresian also have some SSA ancestry with the Eurasian admixture. 36% if I remember right. This could be a carry over from their predecessors in Mauritania the Balfour whom also give rise to you Mende people. The  history of West Africa is still in the dark same goes for genetics. The calculators on Vahaduo are made by hobbyist with limited samples. So I personally wouldn't use their results to set the standard for populations. Results can vary  depending on which calculator is used. Some can give you  fairly accurate results other times not at all even with a good  distance. I've messed around with my own results and family members a good bit on there. The really good calculators for me have been removed. The site creator(I'm friends with him on FB) didn't have the time to keep maintaining it.

Hey everyone,

I recently got my 23andMe and AncestryDNA results back and noticed some interesting differences between the two.

23andMe Highlights:

 * Strong Sub-Saharan African ancestry (81.5%) with a focus on West Africa.

 * Significant European ancestry (16.9%) with a breakdown into Northwestern and Southern European regions.

 * Includes Indigenous American and ""African Diaspora"" components.

AncestryDNA Highlights:

 * Primarily West African ancestry with a focus on specific regions like Benin & Togo, Nigeria, and Cameroon.

 * Smaller European component with ancestry from England, Scotland, and Cornwall.
 * Includes minor components like Indigenous Puerto Rico.

My Questions:

 * Why are there differences in the regional breakdowns, especially within West Africa?
 
 * Has anyone else experienced significant differences between their 23andMe and AncestryDNA results?

I'm curious to hear your thoughts and experiences!

1g5a05j,reddit_post,5,"23 and me says I have a great uncle, but not sure how

I got in touch with “Mike” on Facebook. He was born 1966. He was adopted. We have my grandmother’s side in common it looks more so. My Great Aunt Karen I thought was his mother, but he met his mother. He said his dad is who he is looking for. As far as I know, my Great Aunt Karen is the oldest. 

I am literally so confused!
Is there a way I can look up online somewhere if my Great Grandfather or Great Grandmother gave a child up for adoption? Maybe my Aunt Karen has a twin out there? She doesn’t even know. 

I did 23AndMe. How accurate is that website? We have a 13.98% DNA match and it says he IS my Great Uncle. 

Is there something else I can do, look up, something? Ever since I watched the show Long Lost, I bought this DNA test, and I see a bunch of similarities for health and traits, but some are wrong. I have been really invested in this, and I have no idea how much further I can go. 

Can he still be my Great Uncle if my Great Grandmother’s brother is his father? ",2024-10-16 21:01:12
lsargih,reddit_comment,7,"23 & Me is very accurate, especially with that large of match, but take the Great Uncle with a grain of salt. They're guessing at the relationship.

With 13.98%, you could be 1st cousins or there could be a half-relationship (like half nephew).  Probably 23 & Me is using age difference to figure out how you might be related.

It's possible that he could be related through someone who was given up for adoption, or just not known in the family. My grandmother's father walked out on his family and then started another family who had no idea about my grandmother.  So, these types of DNA tests can bring out a lot of family secrets.

Another possibility is that he's related to you in two different ways, which can happen if your relatives all lived in the same area or when there's quite a few common ancestors (for example, people who are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent). So, you could potentially be something like 1st cousin once removed and 2nd cousins and the match looks closer since 23 & Me can't figure something like that out.",2024-10-17 01:44:16
lsd2u18,reddit_comment,3,"13.98% is about 1040cm according to DNA Painter and has 100% likelihood of being one of the following: (1) great grandparent or great grandchild, (2) great uncle or great nephew, (3) half uncle or half nephew, (4) first cousin.  The son of your great grandmother's brother would be your first cousin twice removed, which is much too distant for 13.98% shared DNA.  He is going to be closer than that.  The great uncle label definitely fits the shared DNA amount, but it doesn't make sense to me because that would mean he would be a full sibling to your grandmother.  If he knows his mother already, and she is not your grandmother's mother, then I don't see how he could be a great uncle. Do you have any uncles old enough to be his father?  And do you know what state he was born and adopted in?  Some states allow adoptees to order their original birth certificate.  And I think all states allow adoptees to get non-identifying information about their birth families, which might contain details that would help you figure out which family member might be his father.",2024-10-17 13:49:22

UPDATE 2: Spoke to my mom today. It was a very civil conversation. When my mom's dad died my grandma was finally free. She ended up getting a new boyfriend and basically kicked all of her kids out of the house. She asked her brother if he would take my mom in and my mom went up there to get a job. Her entire time there she worked for him but he refused to pay her though he let her live with him. He was emotionally and physically abusive to my mom and did what most manipulators do telling her she had no money , was uneducated, had no one that loved her and nowhere to go so she was pretty much stuck. It was a one time thing. He was drunk. When my mom found out she was pregnant he begged her to abort and she wouldn't. When she got the positive she tried to kill herself. She failed. She went to get an abortion and heard my heartbeat and couldn't do it. She wanted to have me, someone that was hers.  He was angry and threatened to hurt us if mom ever told anyone. He was furious she kept me. My mom tried to leave after he hurt me once, but he ended up following her. He kept my mom trapped until she finally went to college and got her degree because she was determined to start her own life and give me a good one away from her family. Before that happened he ended up dying and my mom finally got her shit together. She felt especially trapped when pregnant because she told her mom and her mother was so involved with her own life she didn't care. She told my mom that ""so what? I was offered up to my Uncle when I was little and so was my sister."" They are from Kentucky and I guess a lot of that shit was in our family. When her bf died I guess my grandma became super support mom and was like a second mom to me. My mom said she thinks it was 100% guilt and that's why grandma was super involved in my life and helped my mom get her shit together. So I guess my dad was a terrible person on other levels too. I found out I have two half sisters, but both are dead. Both are older than my mom by 4 or so years. He had the first and wanted nothing to do with her. He ended up cheating on his wife (her mom) with his brother's wife. So I guess a lot of this did go on in my family. He ended up running off with his brother's wife and impregnating her. He then also had nothing to do with that daughter and left. The first daughter became a drug addict and lost her daughter. My dad won custody of her, his granddaughter. I guess my mom ended up pretty much doing all the raising of her. She saw my mom as a mom until she eventually was of age and left and my dad had nothing to do with her either. She's also probably dead because my mom said she was also very into drugs. My mom is so ashamed and was worried I would hate her. It was something she wanted to take to the grave. This is why she lost it when she found out I got a DNA kit because she knew I'd finally learn the truth. It was such a bonding moment to talk today. My poor mother's entire life was garbage. She told me I was her driving force for living. I was what pushed her and if she wouldn't have kept me she feels like she would have been trapped until she killed herself. 

&#x200B;

Where to start. Well, I've never known my dad. When I was in 2nd grade we had to do a family tree and I was unable to add my paternal side. I always begged my mom to tell me about my dad but she wouldn't. She said it was her personal business. I did have a father figure that I called Papa. He was the second person to hold me. He was there while my mom was pregnant. He pretty much raised me and we lived with him until he died. He was my mom's uncle and she said she moved with him when she was 18 because he promised to help her get away from her abusive family and help her make a go of it. She helped him manage his career as a producer for country music. I remember he was pretty much like a dad to me. I would sit on his lap and cuddle and watch movies and he pretty much bought me anything I ever wanted. When he got Alzheimers he went downhill fast. I remember as he got worse my mother visited him less and he started saying more and more that he loved my mom and that I was his baby. My mom said he was confusing us with his ex wife and his daughter who has nothing to do with him anymore. He passed away and I never thought anything different.

&#x200B;

When my grandma had her big stroke she had told me I looked just like my dad, but stopped herself. As a side note I look just like my great uncle, her brother, and we share the same dark eyes and hair and facial features. I have his nose. She had dementia at this point and would often say things from her past that disturbed my mom. One of those times she said to my mom ""Are you ever going to tell that baby who her dad is?""

After grandma passed she confided in me she doesn't know who my dad is and that she was raped while working at a diner. She said he was Hispanic.

Not knowing my dad and wanting to know health reports for me and my son I took 23 and me and recently got my results. No hispanic at all. I was super surprised. I'm completely European. 63% Irish/British, 9% French and German, 3% Scandinavian, and the rest is broadly northwestern Europe. I found GEDMatch and out of curiosity tried the are my parents related tool. It said that my parents are related within the first 3 generations. When I took the CM and put it into DNA painter it said 100% Uncle/Aunt, Niece/Nephew, or Grandchild. My mom was 35 when she had me. Her grandpa died before she was born and her dad killed himself when she was 17. My mom has two uncles. I tried to ask my mom but she got on the defensive, begged me not to take the test, said that 23andme is fake and they don't use your DNA they just pull info about you from social media, and begged me not to talk to any of our living family. She later said I could talk to whoever I wanted because I am an adult but urged me not to. I don't want to disrespect my mom, but I really felt like I had the right to know. It changes nothing. I don't blame my mom or think less of her.

&#x200B;

So I talked to our living family, my grandma's sister's daughter. She was really uncomfortable, but said since I'm adult she'll tell me what she knows. My mom had told her that she was raped at a diner by a Mexican guy and she didn't know who he was. She had asked her mom and her mom said this was not the case. Her mom was my grandma's sister and they were super close, having even lived with each other for a short time before I was born. My grandma told her sister to keep it a secret, but their brother had raped my mom and she was pregnant with me. I was told this was a common thing in our family and a lot of that side of the family sleeps with each other.

So TLDR: TIL that my mom is actually also my cousin, my grandma is actually also my aunt, and my great uncle is also my dad. 29 years of lies uncovered by spit.",2018-12-31 18:58:55

eczpo9w,reddit_comment,26,"I’m uncomfortable with the comments saying the incest between your mom and uncle was consensual. Even if she were 35 at the time and invited him into her home, this is a woman who suffered severe sexual abuse as a young girl (including father-daughter incest/rape) so I’m deeply concerned with assuming she was A-OK with the uncle-niece incest. Even if she were, as a victim of sexual assault/incest, she’s likely not acting in her best interest. Also, you mention that your grandmother told your aunt that you mother was “raped” by her uncle, not that they had a consensual relationship. That’s not a word people typically throw around without intention. 

I’m curious (and obviously don’t expect OP to answer this question) whether there were any other signs or indications of sexual abuse from the uncle, either toward OP, her mother (after OP was born) or anyone else for that matter. It may seem like these questions are irrelevant at this point, but this is OP’s dad... if it were me I think I would want to know. 

I’m so sorry you’re having to go through this and that your mother isn’t more supportive of you. I hope you know that NONE of this is your fault and you have every right to look into your own genetic background. I also hope you and your mom will consider some counseling, together or separately, to work through some of this. This is so much to take in and I’m sorry you have to go through this.

ecyzx4i,reddit_comment,27,"Your story is heart rending! It seems like there's more going on here than meets the eye.  

I'm wondering how it is that your mother has been willing to share the information that she had been raped and impregnated by her father, your grandfather, and forced to abort.  But, now that you've learned the truth about your great uncle, she is somehow overwhelmed with shame to acknowledge that.  Except for an abortion, the same thing happened with your great uncle?  These tragic events are both taken from the same sad chapter of your mother's early life story.

The difference between them is that she kept you and raised you as her daughter.  Perhaps she feels that the first incestuous rape was finished and over with once the abortion happened but this later rape remains unfinished business and she has never recovered from the shame of it?  Please try to do what you can to help her let that shame go.  It's mission critical for both of you here.  Try your best to let her know that you do not blame her for what happened.

Whatever the reason, the fact remains, if you love your mother and she loves you? None of how she got pregnant or who did it really matters now.  She can't go back and change the past and neither can you.  

You can only go forward with the positive things you both share in common.  Hopefully, the most valuable thing you share is your love for one another.  The love of a parent for their child and a child for their parent can help carry them to the end of their days. 

Best wishes for the coming year and here's hoping that this will be true for you both.  This too will pass.

Recently, I have done a lot of research into my family history and have been using ancestry to trace as far back as I can get. Obviously, there are always going to be some faulty elements when doing research (almost completely) on ancestry. But here's what I know-
On my mother's side, my maternal grandmother traces her ancestry back to Palermo, Italy, and primarily Bavaria, Germany. This lineage is 100% confirmed and we have birth/death certificates from this side of the family. Some notable ancestors include:
* 2nd Greatgrandfather and Grandmother born in Palermo, Italy. Both of these lines stay in Palermo as far back as I could trace.
* 2nd Great Grandfather born in Bavaria, Germany. This line also stayed in Bavaria as far back as I could trace.
    * His wife, or my 2nd great grandmother, was born in Austria.
        * 2nd Greatgrandfather and Grandmother were born in Palermo, Italy. Both of these lines stay in Palermo as far back as I could trace.
That's everything I know about my maternal grandmothers line, and I think my very first 23 and me result supported a lot of this.
My maternal grandfather's side is a bit more of a mystery because his family settled in America at a much earlier date. As far back as I could trace though much of this was guesswork, these are the earliest immigrants-
* 7th greatgrandfather from Alsace, France
* 8th great grandfather from germany
* 9th great grandmother and father from Ireland
* 9th and 10th great grandfather from London, England.

My father's side is also a bit of a mystery in some ways, but a lot of this research is supported by relatives on ancestry, with documentation. A lot of this side of the family lived in America since colonial times, but I still found some points of interest. On my paternal grandmother's side-
* 2nd great grandmother born in Ireland. (My grandmother possibly was as well, would never give a straight answer)
* 7th great-grandfather born in Scotland
* 10th great-grandmother and grandfather were from the Netherlands.
On my paternal grandfather's side
* 4th great-grandmother was born in Ireland
* Another 4th great-grandmother and father were born in Ireland
* A different 3rd great grandmother/father were also born in Ireland
* A different 4th great grandfather/mother were born in Bavaria, Germany
* 8th great grandfather/mother were also born in in Germany.

Notably, neither side of my family has any French, save for one ancestor. Don't really know what to make of my results, especially compared to my former 23 and Me ones. Any thoughts are appreciated!

The variance in Italian/Balkan ancestry is also pretty significant I think.",2021-10-09 14:22:40

We’re just now starting to find out how common these non-paternal events (NPEs) are, as commercial genetic testing often lets the cat out of the bag.  For our ancestors, these were often secrets taken to the grave.  I suspect that these ethnicity estimates are more accurate than people give them credit for… because there’s a good chance we all have multiple NPEs in the portion of our tree that contributes meaningfully to our DNA (last 6-7 generations).",2021-10-10 02:31:50

ibmk7nv,reddit_comment,4,"Some initial troubles to point out, to begin with:

* The author of the paper Eran Elhaik is a Khazar Theorist who has been met with criticism by a number of other geneticists. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eran_Elhaik

* The linguist in the paper Paul Wexler and his work has been rejected by other Yiddish and Germanic linguists, and geneticists. His linguistic approach is considered inconsistent with conventional and universal methods of historical linguistics, such as the comparative method. These standard linguistic approaches demonstrate that both Eastern and Western Yiddish are descended from a Middle High German dialect with components of Aramaic and Hebrew vocabulary, which underwent the same regular sound changes as those undergone by the German components.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wexler_(linguist)


Now: I read the article you posted. 


* The author designed the GPS (Geographic Population Structure) algorithm because he disliked the results of other methods.


* To quote the article

> Xue et al. (2017) applied GLOBETROTTER to a dataset of 2,540 AJs genotyped over 252,358 SNPs. The inferred ancestry profile for AJs was 5% Western Europe, 10% Eastern Europe, 30% Levant, and 55% Southern Europe (a Near East ancestry was not considered by the authors). Elhaik (2013) portrayed a similar profile for European Jews, consisting of 25–30% Middle East and large Near Eastern–Caucasus (32–38%) and West European (30%) ancestries.


- When Levantine is taken out as a reference population and another population that represents Anatolia or Caucasus is inserted, the almost half West Asian component of Ashkenazi jumps to it instead. That is what the author has done. 



He is modeling Ashkenazi as a modern unmixed population, using ancient reference groups more to his liking to produce a misconstrued result to support his hypothesis.

Also if the authors were wrong, did AJs and their ancestors play any role in the Silk Road trade routes? Also, are the similarities between AJs and Georgian Mountain Jews because of their shared Levantine ancestry or because of admixture from that region? I’ve heard before that modern Jews are genetically distant from Palestinians because the ancient Levant was more similar to Anatolia and Assyria genetically while the modern Levant is more similar to Arabs, or that the Arab expansion made the Levant much more Arabic genetically. I understand these authors are quacks but it still seems like the Rhineland hypothesis is unconvincing or at least has many holes.

I do however avoid linguistic arguments because I don't know enough about them. Linguistics don't equal genetics. If you do research it further, be sure to research the author and read more than one hypothesis. 


In terms of genetic make-up, this subreddit has a lot of user-submitted data from a plethora of DNA services. For services that don't offer a ""European Jewish"" category, the consistent theme of breakdowns tends to be mainly West Asian and Southern European. Typically this is interpreted as Levantine and Roman/Italian. Jews tend to have smaller denominations of other European DNA. This isn't a coincidence. Most PCA maps don't put Ashkenazi beside Turkish People. They put them beside other Jews, Sicilians (or other MENA mixed Southern Europeans including Meditteranean Islanders), then Levantine people (despite sharing approximately a little under half of the same ancestral group).


Some Jews, have small amounts of East Asian DNA that is believed to have come through the Silk Road. Jews have a long history with the Silk Road. 


It's not unreasonable to suggest that some of the West Asian DNA is from Anatolia or the Caucasus, especially given the proximity to the Levant. There have been Jewish communities in those areas for a long time too, whether they migrated from Judea or converted. However, any assimilation would have a small impact on the overall gene pool.


It's a touchy subject because there are people out there who solely focus on the non-Levantine DNA, emphasizing it, in an attempt to disassociate them from the Levant. 


It swings both ways, there are people who say that Muslim Levantines are all Peninsular Arab migrants. That's false, as the same DNA services show they are Arabized Levantine people who have some admixture but still have Levantine as their biggest denomination (45+%). The admixture varies between Anatolian, ICM, and Egyptian, depending on location. Why is the non-Levantine emphasized? To disassociate them. 


Truth is Jews and modern Levantine populations are all cousins with mothers of different backgrounds.

The OP has entered MLH1 in the Raw Data Explorer and looked at all the SNPs that 23andMe test.  A few of them come up (for most people) as ""-/-"" (there are dozens of them).. And it looks like they should have asked what that meant before delving (external to the 23andMe website) into what it means and what would be caused (Lynch Syndrome) if they didn't have that... 

It's quite simple that if you had anything other than a '-' in these positions then the whole gene would experience a frameshift and destroy the gene product MLH1.. which would hamper the genome surveillance for mismatched DNA pairings leading to DNA repair by BRCA1... The surveillance complex is made up from MLH1, MSH2, ATM, BLM, MSH6, and the RAD50-MRE11-NBS1 complex.  Perhaps the strangeness of seeing -/- and then reading that they all cause Lynch Syndrome (caused by accumulating mutations that don't get repaired) triggered this post.

Say some disorder is one in a million.  Thats a .0001% chance.

What is means is that for every person with the one in a million disorder, the test will also find 10 people without the disorder.  Ten times the false positives versus true ones.

1bbsu3m,reddit_post,6,"23and Me

Hi friends - (28M) Without making an along story out of this I went to my primary because I have been experiencing fatigue, anxiety, some slightly high blood pressure and chest pain. I was sent in for labs and everything came back normal except my iron levels:

Total iron- 157 (seems fairly normal) % saturation- 57 (high out of range)

 Ferritin- 190 (seems fairly normal)

This sparked my curiosity to do 23 and me which showed that I carry one of the HME genes and could be at higher risk for hemochromatosis (why I am here) but after seeing everyone else’s ferritin levels mine seems like pebbles, is it worth pursuing further? I don’t know much about the relation ship between saturation percentage and ferritin levels. I am very active but eat red meat and drink alcohol pretty regular 1-2x per week. I’m sure my anxiety is health related but boy it does stink. Any advice appreciated ",2024-03-11 02:52:01
kubl84o,reddit_comment,4,"Hey! (20) It’s definitely worth pursuing, my ferritin was at 207 and with further testing I was diagnosed at 18 with Alpha thalassemia and Heterozygous Hemochromatosis (C282Y/H63D). It’s not so bad as it seems.

If you do get diagnosed,  here are some things that has helped me ( doesn’t apply to everyone just my experience with it ). :) 

Exercising does use iron so if you want to keep eating red meat make sure to have a turmeric(curcumin) supplement 30min-1hour before eating said meat and be a very active person. 

This helps to limit some absorption of iron. Coffee, tea, matcha are also good ways of limiting absorption and also doing light chelation of said iron ( caffeic acid supposedly chelates iron, I’m also a coffee drinker so I kinda hope it does ) . The chelation part is still something I’m not sure about though. 

A light jog daily with 2x-4x/ week weight training, your favorite sport or martial art can help you not only give you a nice healthy body but also slowly  lower your iron.

You’ll eventually get into the limit your vitamin c intake topic which really is just take the supplement/ food at a different time. 

Really the whole point is, I highly recommend getting tested for it. If it does come positive for HM, this community is more than happy to support you and get you learning more about your body.
Take care :)",2024-03-11 03:50:35

qikhmr,reddit_post,2114,"AITA for following up on DNA report?

I (53M) was born prior to my parents getting married, and am the oldest of four. I have 3 younger sisters. My dad passed away in December of 2020. My mother is in poor health (multiple bypasses, recent stroke, depression), and recently moved in with sister #2.

Last week, 23andMe informed me that I had two half sisters. My dad had at least one affair that we knew about in the 90s, so my sisters and I initially thought that these two girls may be the product of an earlier affair when we lived in the area the two girls are from.

After questioning the two potential half sisters about their family history, I found out that they had already confirmed 100% DNA match with both of their parents six years ago. I was told that I resembled their brother.

All three of my sisters told me the DNA results were wrong. I was my dad’s son. They urged me to not pursue the issue, and told me not to bring this up to my mother.

The elder of the potential sisters and I wanted to unravel the mystery, since 23andMe was telling them I was their uncle. 

Eventually, an exchange of photographs hit me hard. I look exactly like their biological father. I showed the photograph to sister #3, who showed it to sister #1. They changed their minds and told me that I need to find out the truth. 

My problem is this, the biological father of the potential half sister passed away 11 months before my Dad. There are two people I can ask about this and hopefully get an answer: my mother, and her younger sister. One I am forbidden to question, the other would cause a massive s-storm in both families if given the opportunity.

Sister #2 refuses to speak to me.

AITA for wanting to confront my mother on my paternity?


UDATE 1: Shortly after I posted this, sister #3 (48f) submitted her DNA to 23 and Me, she came up as my half sister. With this info, Sisters 1 & 2 (52f and 50f) decided that I should speak with our mother to get answers. Sister 2, however, confronted my mother before giving me the chance to ask the questions I wanted to in the manner I had planned to. Our mother denied knowing my bio father. My mother and I did not speak to one another until July 4th of this year (2022). I have been in contact with paternal sister #1, exchanging photos and stories of family life.

UPDATE 2: My mother arrived for my niece’s wedding. On July 4th, I received a phone call from sister #3 telling me to come up the driveway to my niece’s house, as our mother had something to tell me. After driving the mile up the driveway, I got the full story from my mother. Long story short, I am the result of a sexual assault from someone from my mother’s workplace. I was legally adopted by my Dad 6 months after my birth. I was very much wanted and loved by both of my parents. In fact, my dad was angry that he had to wait 6 months to adopt me and have my birth certificate changed.

I have not updated my paternal siblings yet.",2021-10-29 19:31:23

hik2l09,reddit_comment,1,"NTA. The chances of DNA testing for relationships being false are astronomically low if methodology is followed properly. We're talking fractions of a percent (in spite of what some lawyers might claim on the issue). The issue is that such DNA profiling is subject to human error. 23andMe is actually very reliable in terms of genotyping because of how they have automated the process. The simple geneaology tree checks out too, with 1/4 ratio of half-brother and uncle being identical.

So that aside, your sisters seem to be relying on that assumption of error (a low probability assumption, even if human error may have been an issue), rather than talking frankly of the high probability of being biologically related. Speculating here - perhaps they are embarassed by the situation, and protecting what they perceive as a threat to familial stability in a hard time? I would ask you now then, what do you hope to gain by exposing this and why does it matter? I don't think you're an asshole for wanting to know, but some people do not want an embarassing past brought up if it would jeopardize current family dynamics. Perhaps that is the angle they are taking, and frankly I do understand this even if I personally think it is only a small part of what constitutes a family.",2021-10-29 20:14:26

him0ogi,reddit_comment,1,NTA Not only is is selfish of them to ask you to keep it to yourself but there has clearly been lies told. DNA is not only important to know your family but also health wise.,2021-10-30 05:45:43
hikjesf,reddit_comment,1,"NTA.  This happens so often with DNA testing that there's an acronym for it - NPE (can stand for ""non-paternal event"" or ""not the parent expected"").  People have written books about discovering from DNA tests that the man who raised them wasn't their father. 

My recommendation would be that you find a gentle and loving way to talk to your mom about this - it is a secret she's been carrying for years, and she probably feels guilty / ashamed, and she probably thought it would never come to light.  She may need a lot of reassurance that this doesn't change how you feel about her.",2021-10-29 22:09:46
hijy5cs,reddit_comment,1,INFO what exactly do you hope to achieve? Other than upsetting your mom and creating a scandal? It sounds like you already have your answer.,2021-10-29 19:45:53
hik8cgg,reddit_comment,1,"OP, did those parents do DNA testing via 23andMe or another service? If they did a different service, see about using the same one. That could narrow down which of their parents is your parent or sibling.  If their dad is your dad/sibling then you’d want to ask very different questions than if their mom is. 

Remember that 23andMe is taking a guess on relationships - an uncle and a half sibling will both share around the same percentage of DNA.  Not sure why it’s presuming one for you and differently for them, but it’s may just be you both misunderstanding how accurate 23andMe can actually be.  This can also be a way to start this conversation - “23andMe says I share 25ish% of my DNA with these two women, help me figure out how we are related” will come off as a lot less confrontational than “my dad isn’t their dad, so either their dad is my dad or their mom is my mom so can you explain which?”

All that said - NTA for wanting answers, but please be prepared that you could be opening a can of worms here as there is always a chance that your birth was the result of an assault.

Edit - another idea for sorting this out would be to use the “relatives in common” feature and seeing if they can identify which parent the people who show up are related to. If it’s consistently on one side that could provide some answers as well.",2021-10-29 20:52:45
hikhhfu,reddit_comment,1,"I uncovered my real biodad back in 2019, 2020 was when I met him, 2021 is the year I found out some horrible truths about him. Now I'm not sure how to cope with everything but am building a relationship with my half siblings. My mom shuts down whenever I bring it up so I don't tell her when I visit my half siblings. Anyway, make sure you are prepared for the emotional breakdowns it can occur.",2021-10-29 21:55:57
himnd2v,reddit_comment,1,"NTA for wanting to know.

But it sounds like you already know the answer to your question. Is there a point to potentially causing a family feud?

You could go and see a geneticist together with the likely half-sisters to get a DNA-based confirmation (more reliable than 23 and me) that you share a father.  Then you can keep the result relatively private, and leave your mom with the idea that she succesfully kept it a secret.",2021-10-30 10:46:12

""Mom, I love you and I'm not judging you, but was BioDad my father? Again, not judging, but I would really like some certainty and closure on this issue. Both him and Father have passed away, so there's nobody to hurt with this, just peace of mind to be gained.""",2021-10-30 17:17:27
